I WAS THE FLT ATTENDANT PULLING FIX IN TERMINAL PRIOR TO FLT; AND PAX ADMITTED TO ME; WITH DRINK IN HAND; THAT HE WAS DRINKING BEER. I ALLOWED HIM TO BOARD; BECAUSE HE WAS NOT ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY OR STRANGELY. THE ACTUAL INFLT INCIDENT BEGAN DURING BEVERAGE/FOOD SVC. I WAS BTWN THE BEVERAGE AND MEAL CARTS; AND FLT ATTENDANT #2 WAS LEADING DOWN THE AISLE; DISTRIBUTING BREAKFAST MEALS ON THE AFT END OF THE CART. I BECAME AWARE OF A NEGATIVE VERBAL INTERACTION BTWN FLT ATTENDANT #2 AND THIS PAX. I OVERHEARD FLT ATTENDANT #2 ASK THE PAX IF HE WAS THREATENING OR CHALLENGING HIM. FLT ATTENDANT #2 MOVED ON WITH THE CART. LATER ON; FLT ATTENDANT #2 EXPLAINED TO ME THAT HE ASKED THE PAX TO PUT HIS SEAT UP SLIGHTLY SO THAT THE PAX BEHIND HIM COULD EAT. THE SEAT RECLINED VERY FAR BACK INTO THE OTHER PAX'S LAP AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY EATING. THE PAX IN OFFENSE INITIALLY IGNORED THE FLT ATTENDANT'S REQUEST; AND THEN RESPONDED BACK DEFIANTLY; REFUSED TO MOVE HIS SEAT AND SAID 'LEAVE ME ALONE.' WHILE PICKING UP TRASH; AFTER THE SVC; I NOTICED THE PAX GO TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE ACFT; NEAR THE LAVATORIES. I FOLLOWED IN THAT DIRECTION TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS; WHILE CONTINUING TO PICK UP THE TRASH. THE OTHER 2 FLT ATTENDANTS IN COACH WERE WORKING IN THE AISLE CLOSER TO THE FRONT. I DID NOT NOTICE WHETHER THIS PAX ACTUALLY UTILIZED THE LAVATORY; BUT I NOTICED HE APPEARED TO WAIT FOR THE FLT ATTENDANT #2 TO COME THROUGH THE AISLE BEFORE MAKING HIS WAY BACK TO HIS SEAT; AS IF LOOKING FOR A CONFRONTATION. UPON ENCOUNTERING THE FLT ATTENDANT #2; THEY BOTH TRIED TO PASS EACH OTHER IN THE AISLE; SIDEWAYS; AND THE PAX APPEARED TO INTENTIONALLY BUMP THE FLT ATTENDANT IN THE CHEST. NEGATIVE VERBALIZATIONS WERE AGAIN EXCHANGED. THE PAX SAID TO FLT ATTENDANT #2 'YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A WAITER; I'M A LAWYER; YOU NEED TO SHOW RESPECT.' I APCHED AND CALLED FLT ATTENDANT #2 TO COME BACK TO THE GALLEY (TO BREAK UP THE INTERACTION). AT THAT POINT WE INFORMED THE REST OF THE CREW AND THE COCKPIT THAT THIS PAX WAS AN ESCALATING PROB. (THIS SAME PAX RESPONDED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO ME; AS WELL; WHEN SERVING BEVERAGES. HE RELUCTANTLY TOOK AN ORANGE JUICE; GULPED IT DOWN AND SHOVED THE CUP BACK AT ME. WHEN ASKED TO PLEASE HOLD IT OR PLACE IT ON THE FLOOR UNTIL I CAME BACK WITH A TRASH BAG; HE THREW IT ON THE FLOOR.) A PAX A FEW ROWS BACK CALLED ME OVER AND SAID THIS PAX IS A REAL PROB. WE SAW HIM IN THE TERMINAL AND HE WAS DRINKING ALCOHOL. THE CREW FILLED OUT THE APPROPRIATE SAFETY PAPERS; AND FLT ATTENDANT #2 GAVE THE 'WARNING' FORM TO THE PAX. I WATCHED; AS THE PAX TOOK THE FORM; GLANCED AT IT; AND THEN CRUMPLED IT UP AND PUT IT IN THE SEAT POCKET. HE KEPT TO HIMSELF FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT; 'PRETENDED' TO BE SLEEPING. I BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROB AND WHICH CAN BE CHANGED TO PREVENT FUTURE RECURRENCES OF SIMILAR INCIDENCES: 1) ALCOHOL -- STRICTER RULES REGARDING ALCOHOL USE AND FLYING. 2) PERSONAL SPACE VIOLATIONS -- RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR PERSONAL SPACE; AND SHOWS THAT INCREASED NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR (INCLUDING VIOLENCE) OCCURS WHEN PERSONAL SPACE IS VIOLATED. OUR ACFT ARE GETTING TOO CROWDED -- TOO MANY SEATS IN TOO LITTLE SPACE. ADD ON TOO MUCH CARRY-ON LUGGAGE; AND THE STRESSES OF AIR TRAVEL AND YOU ARE LUCKY MORE FIGHTS DON'T OCCUR. THIS FLC DID A GREAT JOB AT DE-ESCALATING A POTENTIALLY PHYSICAL SIT. THE PAX WAS A MALE; AND THE FLT ATTENDANT MOST INVOLVED WAS A MALE. I BELIEVE WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO A PHYSICAL FIGHT INFLT. FLT ATTENDANT #2 AND I WERE DISAPPOINTED; HOWEVER; THAT NOTHING WAS DONE WITH THIS PAX UPON LNDG. NO OFFICIAL WARNING; REPRIMAND OR PUNITIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. WE WERE INFORMED THAT IT HAS TO GET 'PHYSICAL' FOR THE OFFICIALS TO MEET THE AIRPLANE; BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TRY TO AVOID ESCALATING THE SIT. THIS PAX VERBALLY HARASSED THE FLT ATTENDANT #2 SEVERAL TIMES; HE PHYSICALLY BUMPED HIM; ANDHE WAS SEEN DRINKING BY ME (FLT ATTENDANT #4) PREBOARDING AND BY PAX IN THE TERMINAL. WE BELIEVE SOME TYPE OF ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN; BECAUSE NOW THIS PAX THINKS HE CAN ACT THIS WAY AND GET AWAY WITH IT. AND THE WAY THE RULES ARE NOW; I GUESS HE CAN.

PAX LOAD 13/108. APPROX XA00 I WAS IN THE FIRST CLASS AISLE SERVING DESSERT. I WAS AT ROW A READY TO SERVE. THE SVC WAS COMPLETELY OVER IN MAIN CABIN; NO CARTS OR FLT ATTENDANTS IN THE AISLE. THE CURTAIN WAS PULLED CLOSED BTWN FIRST CLASS AND MAIN CABIN. 2 LARGER BUILT LADIES CAME BARRELING THROUGH THE CURTAIN; RAN UP TO ME (IN THE AISLE) AND ONE SAID; 'GET OUT OF MY WAY!' I LOOKED AT THEM PUZZLED AND THEY PROCEEDED TO SHOUT AT ME TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY; THEY WERE GOING TO THE FIRST CLASS BATHROOM. THEY BOTH GOT IN MY FACE YELLING AND COMPLETELY PREVENTING ME FROM SERVING MY PAX. THE CURTAIN DIVIDING FIRST CLASS AND MAIN CABIN WAS 1/4 OPEN ON THE R-HAND SIDE AND I COULD SEE CLRLY TO THE REAR OF COACH -- NO ONE WAS WAITING FOR THE LAVATORIES AND NO ONE WAS IN THE AISLE. I POLITELY ASKED THE 2 LADIES TO PLEASE USE THE LAVATORIES IN THE BACK; AS I WAS STILL SERVING MY FIRST CLASS PAX THEIR MEAL SVC. THEY REFUSED AND SHOUTED; 'THEY ALWAYS USE THE FIRST CLASS BATHROOMS' AND FOR ME 'TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY' AT THIS POINT; I STARTED TO TURN AROUND TO GO BACK TO THE GALLEY AND GET OUT OF THEIR WAY; WHEN ONE OF THE LADY PAX LATER IDENTED AS MS Y HIT ME ON MY UPPER BODY; R SHOULDER AREA; AND SHOVED ME WITH SUCH FORCE BACKWARDS INTO A SEAT. I SAID; SHOCKED; 'YOU HIT ME.' AND SHE REPLIED; 'YES; I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT OF MY WAY.' MS Y THEN PROCEEDED TO THE FIRST CLASS LAVATORY AND WENT IN AND SLAMMED THE DOOR. THE SECOND LADY PAX; TRAVELING WITH MS Y; LATER IDENTED AS MS X; KEPT UP THE VERBAL ASSAULT ON ME. MS X THEN SHOVED BY ME AND STOOD OUTSIDE THE FIRST CLASS LAVATORY. MS X STARTED YELLING AT FLT ATTENDANT Z; WHO WAS SEATED ON THE FIRST CLASS FLT ATTENDANT JUMP SEAT. I GOT MYSELF TOGETHER IN THE AISLE AND THEN WENT TO THE FIRST CLASS GALLEY AND TRIED TO CALM MS X DOWN AND EXPLAIN (AS FLT ATTENDANT Z WAS TRYING TO DO) THAT FIRST CLASS PAX HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THE 'TFC THROUGH THEIR CABIN' AND THE FACT THEY COULDN'T GET IN THE FIRST CLASS LAVATORIES FOR THE COACH PAX. I FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT WE HAD ONLY 2 CREW MEMBERS IN THE COCKPIT AND THIS WAS THE ONLY LAVATORY THEY COULD USE AND WHEN ONE WAS OUT OF THE COCKPIT; ONLY ONE WAS LEFT TO FLY THE ACFT; SO; IT WAS IMPORTANT THEY WERE IN AND OUT FAST. AT THAT VERY MOMENT; CAPT OPENED THE COCKPIT DOOR TO USE THE LAVATORY. HE HEARD MS X YELLING; SO HE THEN STAYED IN THE COCKPIT AND CLOSED THE DOOR; RATHER QUICKLY. MS X KEPT HER VERBAL ATTACK UP ON FLT ATTENDANT Z AND MYSELF. SHE REFUSED TO CALM DOWN AND GET HERSELF UNDER CTL; AS WE REQUESTED. AT THIS POINT; I WENT TO THE COCKPIT AND INFORMED THE CAPT OF THE PAX ASSAULT. CAPT AND I DISCUSSED SHOULD WE LAND NOW? AND OUR GENERAL COURSE OF ACTION. I TOLD CAPT I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE FOLLOWING FLT ATTENDANT INSTRUCTIONS WITH REGARDS TO PAX MISCONDUCT. HE SAID FINE; TAKE THE 'NOTICE' FORM TO THE PAX AND GIVE THEM HIS NAME AND ASK THEM TO PLEASE READ THE FORM. THE BELIEF BEHIND THIS FORM; IS THAT UPON READING THE STRONGLY WORDED FACTS; THAT THE PAX WILL REALIZE THAT THE SIT IS A VERY SERIOUS SIT AND CALM DOWN. I DISCREETLY APCHED SEATS (NO ONE WAS IN SEAT; APPARENTLY MR X WAS IN THE BACK OF THE ACFT) AND I QUIETLY GAVE THE 2 LADY PAX EACH A FORM ALONG WITH THE CAPT'S NAME AND ASKED THEM TO PLEASE READ THIS FORM; AS THE CAPT REQUESTED. MS Y GRABBED THE FORM FROM MY HAND; WADDED IT UP AND THREW THE FORM ON THE FLOOR. MS X FOLDED IT AND RAMMED IT IN THE SEATBACK POCKET. MS Y SAID 'SHE DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE CAPT REQUESTED; SHE WASN'T READING ANYTHING.' I REPLIED; 'I WAS SORRY SHE WOULDN'T COOPERATE AND DO AS THE CAPT ASKED; THAT SHE LEFT THE CREW NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO HAVE THE AUTHS MEET OUR FLT AND SPEAK WITH THEM.' I THEN RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT AND THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REQUEST THE POLICE MEET THE FLT AND REMOVE THE 2 PAX. DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT; SEVERAL FIRST CLASS PAX CAME TO ME AND GAVE ME THEIR BUSINESS CARDS AND SAID THEY WOULD BE WITNESSES. THEY SAID THEY WERE SHOCKED AND UPSET OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. PRIOR TO LNDG; THE CAPT MADE A PA AND ASKED ALL THE PAX TO REMAIN SEATED WHEN THE ACFT REACHED THE GATE; WHILE THE AUTHS CAME ON. UPON LNDG AND REACHING THE GATE; 2 POLICEMEN CAME ON BOARD TO SEATS A AND B AND ESCORTED THEM OFF THE ACFT. DURING DEPLANING; MR X (HUSBAND OF ONE OF THE WOMEN) CAME TO ME (AS I STOOD AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE ACFT SAYING GOOD-BYE TO OUR PAX) AND GOT SO IN MY FACE HIS SPITTLE HIT ME IN THE FACE AND SHOUTED AT ME 'HOW LONG DOES ACR KEEP THE PAX MANIFESTO?' I REPLIED; 'I DIDN'T KNOW; TO PLEASE ASK THE AGENTS OR THE POLICE.' HE KEPT SHOUTING AT ME AND THE POLICE CAME ON BOARD AND ESCORTED HIM AWAY FROM ME AND WITH THEM. CAPT AND I WENT WITH ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER TO THE ARPT POLICE OFFICE. I THEN FILED A RPT WITH THE POLICE. THE POLICE TOLD ME; 1 COPY GOES TO THE FAA FOR THEIR FEDERAL PROSECUTION AND 1 TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. AS A PROFESSIONAL FLT ATTENDANT FOR MANY YRS; I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT A PAX ASSAULT CANNOT -- EVEN FOR 1 SECOND -- BE TOLERATED; OTHERWISE NO FLT OR CREW MEMBER IS SAFE. MY R SHOULDER AND R ARM HURT VERY BADLY; WITH PAIN RADIATING UP MY NECK AND DOWN MY R ARM; ON THE MORNING OF MAY/XA/99. I HAD BRUISES ON MY R ARM FROM BEING HIT. ON MAY/XB/99; AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF ACR MEDICAL; I WENT TO THE EMER ROOM AND SAW A DOCTOR WHO PUT MY ARM IN A SLING; GAVE ME 2 PRESCRIPTIONS AND ORDERED PHYSICAL THERAPY. DOCTOR PUT ME OFF WORK FOR 1 WK. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR IS VERY UPSET WITH THE FAA AND FBI FOR THE WAY THEY ARE HANDLING; OR NOT HANDLING; THE CASE. SHE TALKED TO THE FBI AGENT ASSIGNED TO HER CASE; AND THEY HAVE DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES. THE POLICE HAD INVESTIGATED AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS GOING TO PROSECUTE THE WOMAN; BUT THE FBI ORDERED HER TO DROP THE LCL CHARGES; BECAUSE IF THE FBI WAS INVOLVED; THE WOMAN COULDN'T BE PROSECUTED TWICE; SO SHE DROPPED THE CASE WITH THE POLICE AND BELIEVED THE FBI; THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PROSECUTE THE WOMAN. SHE SAID THE FBI AGENTS INTERROGATED HER FOR 2 1/2 HRS; LIKE THE CRIMINAL; NOT THE VICTIM. BECAUSE THE POLICE DIDN'T 'MIRANDIZE' THE WOMAN; THE FBI CHOSE NOT TO PROSECUTE; EVEN THOUGH THE WOMAN ADMITTED TO THE CAPT AND THE POLICE THAT SHE HAD HIT THE RPTR. THE RPTR IS STILL OFF WORK WITH THE SHOULDER INJURY AND WILL BE HAVING SURGERY SOON. SHE FEELS THAT ALL THE FARS THAT THE FAA SPOUTS AS PROTECTION FOR FLCS FROM ASSAULT BY PAX ARE JUST EMPTY THREATS; AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF ENFORCING REGS; BY PROSECUTION; TO PROTECT FLCS.",,,,"FLT ATTENDANT RPT; S80; DFW-OAK; PAX ASSAULTED PURSER; PAX ARRESTED BY POLICE.

THE FAA INSPECTOR COUNTED THE PAX AND QUESTIONED THE MOTHERS ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S AGES. HE AGREED WITH ME THAT THERE WERE 7 PAX WITH 2 OF THEM BEING LAP CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 2 YRS. A SECOND INSPECTOR WAS TAKING NAMES AND SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A 6TH CHILD OF AGE 2 1/2 YRS OLD. THIS IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY COMMON OCCURRENCE IN ALASKA AS THE PAX TRY TO TRANSPORT THEIR CHILDREN FOR FREE.

I AM CALLING THE CAPT TO RADIO AHEAD FOR THE POLICE; THEY WILL MEET THE ACFT AND YOU'LL BE TAKEN.' AT THAT POINT; I TURNED MY BACK TO THE SIT; PICKED UP THE PHONE; CALLED THE CAPT. AT THAT TIME; THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT HAD COME BACK TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. SHE ASKED THE PAX TO RETURN TO HER SEAT; WHICH SHE DID. SHE NO LONGER INTERFERED WITH OUR SVC THE REST OF THE FLT.

A FEMALE PAX HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF ONE OF THE LAVATORIES; AND THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT AND MYSELF THOUGHT THAT THE PAX MAY HAVE SMOKED A CIGARETTE. FLT ATTENDANT #2 WENT BACK TO INVESTIGATE; WHILE I CONTINUED SERVING BEVERAGES. THE FEMALE PAX APPEARED VERY AGITATED THAT I WOULD NOT MOVE THE BEVERAGE CART UNTIL THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT RETURNED. THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF AND FLT ATTENDANT #2 RETURNED SAYING THAT THE LAVATORY DID NOT SMELL LIKE SMOKE AND NOTHING APPEARED OUT OF NORMAL. WE ALLOWED THE PAX TO RETURN TO HER SEAT AND CONTINUED THE SVC. NOT MORE THAN 1 MIN LATER; THE MID CABIN L SIDE LAVATORY FIRE ALARM WENT OFF. FLT ATTENDANT #2 AND I MADE EYE CONTACT AND HE TOLD ME TO LOOK IN THE CABIN. MY BACK WAS TO THE CABIN AND I TURNED AROUND AND SAW A SMOKY HAZE IN THE CABIN. AT THAT POINT WE ROLLED THE CART BACK TO THE GALLEY. I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT THE #3 AND #5 FLT ATTENDANTS WERE DOING. BY THAT TIME THE CABIN HAZE HAD THICKENED CONSIDERABLY. I GRABBED THE HALON AND OXYGEN EXTINGUISHERS; AND PBE'S. FLT ATTENDANT #2 CALLED THE COCKPIT WHILE I WAS DOING THIS. HE THEN TOOK ONE OF THE EXTINGUISHERS AND MOVED FORWARD THROUGH THE CABIN LOOKING FOR THE SOURCE OF SMOKE. I STAYED AFT AND BEGAN LOOKING IN THE LAVATORIES; AND THE GALLEY WITH THE #3 FLT ATTENDANT. I THEN CALLED THE COCKPIT AND RELAYED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO FIND A SOURCE IN THE AFT AREA. AT THIS POINT THE AFT LAVATORY SIGNAL WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE CAPT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HEARD IT AND HUNG UP. FLT ATTENDANT #2 RETURNED TO THE AFT CABIN TO TRY AND TURN OFF THE SIGNAL BUT NEITHER HE NOR I WERE ABLE TO DO IT. WE GOT OUR MANUALS AND HEARD THE CAPT SAY ON THE PA 'FLT ATTENDANTS TAKE YOUR SEATS.' I WAS TOLD BY THE OTHER FLT ATTENDANTS LATER THAT I MADE THE PA FOR FASTEN SEATBELTS; ETC; IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH; BUT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING THIS. WE DID NOT TAKE OUR SEATS; BUT INSTEAD GOT MARKET BAGS AND STARTED PICKING UP THE CABIN AND TELLING PAX TO LOOK AT THEIR SAFETY BRIEFING CARDS. BY THIS TIME I HAD MOVED TO THE FORWARD PART OF THE CABIN; CHKING SEATBELTS; ETC. I SPOKE WITH THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT WHO RELAYED THAT THEY HAD NOT FOUND A SOURCE OF SMOKE; AND THAT THE CAPT HAD GIVEN HIM NO INFO SO FAR. I RETURNED TO THE AFT CABIN FEELING THE FLOOR EVERY FEW FT NOT NOTICING ANY HEAT. ALSO; I KNEW OF AN AIR CREW WHO WERE SEATED BY THE WINDOW EXITS. I QUIETLY TOLD THEM THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF AN EVAC; HOWEVER; SHOULD THE CAPT INITIATE AN EVAC TO OPEN UNOBSTRUCTED EXITS AND GET OUT. I DID THE SAME ON MY WAY BACK TO MY JUMP SEAT WITH THE FLC SEATED IN THE LAST 2 ROWS OF THE CABIN AND EXPLAINED THAT TO LISTEN TO THE CREW'S INSTRUCTIONS IF WE HAD TO EVAC. I NOTICED MANY PAX CRYING AND PRAYING; INCLUDING A FEW CREW MEMBERS. (THEIR CREW WAS A CREW OF 12.) THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT CALLED BACK AND TOLD US ALL THAT WE HAD 10 MINS; THE SIGNAL WAS 'EASY VICTOR;' AND THAT WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE CHKLIST. AT THAT TIME; THE CAPT CAME ON THE PA AND TOLD THE PAX THAT WE WERE LNDG IN KEY WEST AND FOR THE FLT ATTENDANTS TO TAKE THEIR SEATS. AT THAT MOMENT; A LOUD STATIC SOUND CAME OVER THE PA AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO GET VERY SCARED. WE WALKED THROUGH THE CABIN AND REASSURED PAX IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE OK; TO STAY IN THEIR SEATS AND LISTEN FOR INSTRUCTIONS. PRIOR TO LNDG; I LOOKED IN THE CABIN AND SAW MANY PAX PUTTING ON THEIR LIFE VESTS. AFTER LNDG; WE SAW EMER VEHICLES. FIREFIGHTERS BOARDED THE AIRPLANE ASKING US IF ANYONE NEEDED EMER ASSISTANCE. #2 FLT ATTENDANT STAYED BY THE DOORS. I DID A QUICK WALK THROUGH THE CABIN AND NOTICED A FEMALE PAX APPEARING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY BREATHING. SHE HAD TAKEN AN AIR SICKNESS BAG AND WAS BREATHING IN IT. I GOT THE MEDICS AND WE MOVED HER TO FIRST CLASS. SHE MENTIONED SHE WAS ASTHMATIC; TAKING VENTALIN; AND IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR HER TO HYPERVENTILATE WHILE UNDER STRESS. THE MEDICS TOOK OVER FROM THERE. WE WAITED AND DEPLANED BY FORWARD STAIRS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR SAID THAT CABIN CREW NEVER FOUND OUT THE SOURCE OF THE SMOKE; AND THAT 3 LAVATORIES (MID AND AFT) HAD SIMULTANEOUS SMOKE ALARMS GO OFF. THE CABIN CREW EVEN TRIED TO GET THEIR UNION TO FOLLOW THROUGH. BECAUSE THE CAPT HAD IT LISTED AS A DIVERSION; AND NOT AN EMER LNDG; SHE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING ANYONE IN THE COMPANY OR THE UNION TO FOLLOW UP ON IT. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE WHOLE FLT WAS THE CAPT'S LACK OF COM. HIS ONLY CONVERSATION; WAS TO COME OUT OF THE COCKPIT; TAKE ONE LOOK AT THE SMOKE IN THE CABIN; AND SAY IN FRONT OF FIRST CLASS PAX; 'OH *&^%!' AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE COCKPIT. SHE SAID THAT SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THE CAPT WAS NEW AND THAT THE FO WAS FLYING THAT LEG. THE CAPT NEVER ONCE EXPLAINED TO THE CABIN CREW WHAT WAS WRONG OR IF THEY SHOULD PREPARE FOR AN EVAC. HE MADE A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FLT ATTENDANTS TO TAKE THEIR SEATS; THAT THEY WERE LNDG IN KEY WEST; WITH NO FORTHCOMING INFO. SHE INFORMED THE DEADHEADING OFF-LINE CREW TO REVIEW THEIR EMER PROCS; AND TO HELP WITH AN EVAC; IF NECESSARY. THEY ALSO TOLD THE PEOPLE SITTING AT EXITS TO BE PREPARED TO OPEN THE EXITS IN AN EMER. THE AIRLINE FERRIED IN AN AIRPLANE AND THEY WENT ON TO CANCUN WITH SAME PLTS AND PAX. EVEN THEN; THE CAPT WOULDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING. SHE SAID SHE HEARD THAT THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN OUT THE NEXT DAY; AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.",,,,"FLT ATTENDANT RPT; B757; MIA-CUN; DIVERT TO KEY WEST AT BOCA CHICA NAS; SMOKE IN CABIN; 3 LAVATORY SMOKE ALARMS ACTIVATED.",

I LEFT MY PURSE ON A JUMP SEAT AND AS THIS PAX WAS OPENING IT; ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT CAUGHT HIM. HE USED SOME UNRECOGNIZABLE EXCUSE AND WE USED THE WORD 'POLICIA.' HE CONTINUED TO BOTHER US FROM TIME-TO-TIME DURING THE REMAINING 4 HRS OR SO; AND 2 FEMALE PAX SEATED NEXT TO HIM COMPLAINED HE WAS BOTHERING THEM. FLT ATTENDANT #3 MOVED THEM TO OTHER SEATS. WHILE I WAS ON MY BREAK; ANOTHER PAX TOLD A FLT ATTENDANT THAT HER WALLET WAS MISSING (WITH $1000 AND 10000 PESOS). SHE WAS SEATED NEAR THIS MAN. ON LNDG IN DFW; POLICE ARRESTED AND SEARCHED HIM AND FOUND THE WALLET. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE PRIMARY RPTR SAID THAT THE MAN WAS POKING 2 TEENAGE GIRLS SITTING NEXT TO HIM ON THEIR SHOULDERS. HE WAS CAUGHT RIFLING THROUGH THE RPTR'S PURSE BEFORE HE COULD STEAL ANYTHING. SHE SAID HE CAUGHT THEIR ATTN BECAUSE HE WAS DRUNK AND HANGING AROUND THE GALLEY; DEMANDING MORE LIQUOR. THE FO GOT INVOLVED; AND DEALT WITH THE MAN. ON ARR IN DFW; THE RPTR AND ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT BLOCKED THE EXIT OF THE MAIN CABIN; SO THE PAX WOULDN'T DEPLANE. THE FO ESCORTED THE POLICE TO THE BACK SO HE COULD POINT THE MAN OUT TO THE POLICE; WHO WALKED BACK AND ARRESTED HIM. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 445208: WE REFUSED TO SERVE ANY ALCOHOLIC DRINKS TO HIM. A LADY PAX WITH HER SON; CAME TO MAIN CABIN GALLEY AND TOLD ME THAT HER WALLET WAS GONE WHEN SHE WENT TO TOILET. SHE HAD OVER $1000 CASH IN HER WALLET. SHE THINKS THAT DRUNK PAX TOOK HER WALLET BECAUSE THERE WAS AN EMPTY WINE BOTTLE NEXT TO HER PURSE. WE RPTED TO PURSER AND CAPT ABOUT INCIDENT.

ABOUT 2 HRS INTO THE FLT; I WAS IN THE BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR WHEN A WOMAN FROM THE L SIDE OF BUSINESS CLASS CAME INTO THE SVC CTR AND WAS COMPLAINING THAT SHE HAD PAID FULL FARE AND ONLY HER HUSBAND AND HERSELF WERE ALLOWED TO SIT IN BUSINESS CLASS. SHE HAD 2 DAUGHTERS. SHE WAS TOLD THE FLT WAS FULL BY ALL OF US. IT APPEARED AT THAT TIME THAT HER MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT HER GIRLS WERE PUT IN THE LAST ROW OF COACH AND SHE WANTED US TO MOVE THE GIRLS TO BUSINESS CLASS. OF COURSE WE HAD NO EMPTY SEATS SO WE COULD NOT DO IT EVEN IF WE WANTED TO. SHE WENT ON AND ON; ASKING HOW THEY DECIDE WHO WILL SIT WHERE. I BELIEVE SHE WAS AN ACR Y PAX AS SHE KEPT SAYING HOW ACR Y DOES IT. SHE WAS TOLD THAT WITH ACR X; PEOPLE CAN REQUEST THEIR SEAT ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT TOLD HER IN EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE; SHE KEPT ASKING WHY. I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD TALK TO THE TICKET AGENTS WHEN SHE GETS OFF SO THEY CAN EXPLAIN WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO. I LEFT THE BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR. A WHILE LATER SHE WAS BACK IN BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR. THIS TIME; HER APPEARANCE LOOKED DIFFERENT TO ME. HER EYES AND HER MANNERISM APPEARED AS IF SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK. SHE WENT BACK INTO HER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FACT SHE WAS A FULL PAYING PAX. (I AM NOT SURE WHAT SHE MEANT; FULL FARE BUSINESS CLASS OR FULL FARE SECOND CLASS WITH AN UPGRADE.) SHE STILL WANTED TO KNOW HOW WE CHOSE WHO WOULD SIT WHERE. I LEFT THE BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR. ABOUT 30-40 MINS BEFORE WE WERE TO LAND IN JFK; THIS WOMAN CAME BACK TO THE BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR AGAIN; AND THIS TIME SAID SOMEONE TOLD HER THAT THE MAN SITTING NEXT TO HER GIRLS IN THE LAST ROW OF COACH WAS A JERK. I WENT BACK TO COACH AND SAW THE MAN SITTING THERE IN THE LAST ROW; L SIDE ON AISLE. I LOOKED HIM OVER GOOD. HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG AT THE TIME. HIS CLOTHES WERE ALL INTACT. I MADE A POINT TO LOOK HIM OVER GOOD. I THEN LOOKED IN THE SECOND CLASS SVC CTR AND ASKED FLT ATTENDANT 'WHO TOLD THE MOTHER THAT HER GIRLS WERE NEXT TO A JERK?' FLT ATTENDANT JUST SAID THAT THE MAN NEXT TO THE GIRLS WAS; AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FLT; BEING NASTY BY SAYING HE DID NOT LIKE SITTING NEXT TO CHILDREN. SOMETHING LIKE CHILDREN ARE NOISY. HE WAS TALKING LOUD SO HE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE WHO HEARD IT. HE DID NOT LIKE ALL THE NOISE. SO SHE TOLD THE GIRLS DO NOT PAY ANY ATTN TO HIM; HE IS JUST A JERK. I TOLD HER THAT THE MOTHER CAME IN THE SVC CTR AND TOLD US THAT SOMEONE TOLD HER THAT HER CHILDREN WERE NEXT TO A JERK. THEY APPEARED BY SIZE TO BE AT LEAST 10 OR 12 YRS OLD OR SO. I COULD NOT SEE THEIR FACES; AS THEY WERE NOT LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION. I CANNOT ALWAYS TELL BY SIZE; HOW OLD SOMEONE IS. WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE BUSINESS CLASS SVC CTR; A MAN AND WOMAN TOLD ME THAT HAD SEEN A MAN TAKEN OFF FLT XY BY 3 POLICEMEN. THEY DESCRIBED HIS CLOTHING AND I WENT ONCE AGAIN TO CHK HIM OUT. THEY ALSO SAID HE HAD A HAT ON. HE HAD ON BLACK JEANS AND WHITE T-SHIRT WITH SOME CIRCULAR WRITING ON IT. THE MOTHER WAS SITTING NEXT TO THE MAN NOW; WITH 1 GIRL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF HER. THE MOTHER NEXT TO THE MAN HAD HER BACK TO HIM. I HEARD LATER IN THE VAN THAT THE MOTHER TOLD THE AGENT THAT THE MAN HAD HIS PANTS UNZIPPED. WHEN I SAW HIM THE 2 TIMES; HE DEFINITELY HAD HIS PANTS ZIPPED UP. THE PEOPLE HAD HEARD ALL THE GOINGS ON. EVERYONE WAS CONCERNED THAT ACR X TOOK HIM OFF OF ONE FLT AND PUT HIM ON ANOTHER ACR X FLT. I SUSPECT THE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP WITH THE MOTHER AND TOLD HER THE MAN WAS TAKEN OFF A PREVIOUS FLT. WHAT I THINK CAN BE DONE TO RELIEVE EXISTING PROBS OF THIS SORT: 1) THIS MAN SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO GET ON ANOTHER FLT. HIS NAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY AND AN ALERT ADVISOR PUT BY HIS NAME. 2) I FEEL PARENTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE TO BUY TICKETS IN THE SAME CABIN AS THEIR CHILDREN AND SHOULD SIT WITH THEM. AT LEAST UP TO AGE 15. IT SHOULD NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS TO JUDGE WHO WILL GET DRUNK AND OR FROM HOW MANY DRINKS. SOMEONE PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS: WHY DOES ANYONE NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN 2 DRINKS WHILE IN AN AIRPLANE WHERE YOU NEED TO BE IN YOUR SEAT? I SEE PEOPLE DRINK 5 OR 6 GLASSES OF WINE; ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO TELL BY HOW THEY LOOK IF THEY COULD GET OUT OF AN AIRPLANE IN AN EMER OR NOT IF THEY HAVE HAD TOO MANY DRINKS. THEY ARE SITTING DOWN AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE THEIR CONDITION WHEN THEY GET UP OR IN AN EMER SIT. I AM A SMALL WOMAN; I COULD NOT DRAG A DRUNK ADULT OUT OF AN ACFT. THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO GIVE BAD ATTITUDES TO FLT ATTENDANTS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE US TO GET A FREE WHATEVER OR UPGRADE AND WHO WILL NOT COMPLY WITH SAFETY REGS. IF THE AIRLINES WOULD ALSO STOP MAKING SOME PEOPLE SPECIAL AND OTHERS OBEY THE RULES; IT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL ALL AROUND. WHILE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND AM ON REGULATION SUBJECTS; THE CELL PHONE SIT IS ALSO OUT OF HAND. MANY PEOPLE USE THEIR PHONES IN THE LAVATORIES OR EVEN IN THEIR SEATS ON THE RWY WHEN FLT ATTENDANTS ARE IN THEIR JUMP SEATS AND CANNOT SEE THEM. THEY ALSO GET ON AND PULL OUT THE PHONES WHILE BOARDING BECAUSE OTHER AIRLINES LET THEM USE THE PHONES ON THE GND. THEY SAY IT IS A MONEY THING WITH ACR AND NOT AN FAA REG OR IT WOULD BE SO ON ALL AIRLINES. THEY RESENT IT A LOT. A PA SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE PEOPLE GET ON THE ACFT IN THE BOARDING LOUNGE; AND STILL SOME FOLKS MAY SAY THEY WERE IN THE RESTROOM OR WHATEVER AND NEVER HEARD THAT. IF YOU ARE GOING TO CALL IT AN FAA RULE; IT NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER AIRLINES. I WAS PREVIOUSLY A HEALTH AND SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE FOR 4 YRS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE INFO WAS HEARSAY ABOUT THE MAN FROM 2 PAX SITTING ACROSS FROM THE GALLEY; WHO HEARD THE FLT ATTENDANTS TALKING WITH THE WOMAN. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS THE SAME MAN WHO HAD BEEN ESCORTED OFF BY AUTHS FROM ANOTHER AIRPLANE EARLIER THAT DAY.

NO PORTUGUESE SPEAKERS WERE PROVIDED. THE TEENAGERS WERE LOUD; UNRULY; AND SEEMED TO ENJOY BREAKING THE FEW RULES THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD. THE FLT OPERATED AT A REDUCED LEVEL OF SAFETY AND WAS EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT FOR ANYONE THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE TOUR GROUP. THIS FLT ALSO HAD SUPVR FOR THE DALLAS FSDO ON BOARD. HE WAS ON A FULL FARE TICKET TRAVELING ON FAA BUSINESS. MOST OF THE PROBS DISCUSSED HERE WERE BROUGHT TO MY ATTN BY FSDO AFTER WE WERE IN THE CRUISE PHASE OF FLT. MY RECOMMENDATIONS COME FROM TALKING TO THE FLT ATTENDANT AFTER MY DEBRIEF WITH FSDO. HE POINTED OUT 2 SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS: 1) NON ENGLISH SPEAKING STUDENTS WERE ASSIGNED SEATS IN THE EXIT ROWS. THIS WAS DISCOVERED AND CORRECTED BY THE FLT ATTENDANT IN THE LAST 5-10 MINS PRIOR TO DEP. 2) EMER EXIT ROW PAX HAD CARRY-ON BAGS OUT AND ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF THEM; BUT NOT UNDER THE SEAT IN FRONT OF THEM DURING THE PWR BACK. FLT ATTENDANT HAD THE ITEMS STOWED INITIALLY; BUT THEY WERE PULLED OUT AFTER THEY STARTED DOING THEIR DEMO. IT WAS RPTEDLY STOWED CORRECTLY PRIOR TO TKOF. ALTHOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY STATED BY FSDO; THERE WAS A REDUCED LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE SEATBELT SIGN IN ALL PHASES OF FLT. ONCE THE CONDUCT OF THE GROUP BECAME KNOWN TO ME; I TALKED TO THEIR CHAPERONES AND INFORMED THEM THAT IF THERE WAS NOT AN IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT; I WOULD HAVE THE ENTIRE GROUP'S TICKETS REVOKED FOR THEIR REMAINING TRAVEL ON ACR. WHILE THIS MAY HAVE EXCEEDED WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE; IT DID SEEM TO RESULT IN IMPROVED BEHAVIOR. DURING THIS ENTIRE FLT; THE FLT ATTENDANTS WORKED VERY HARD AND PROFESSIONALLY TO ESTABLISH CTL. IT WAS A CASE OF 3 AGAINST 82; AND I DO NOT THINK ANY 3 FLT ATTENDANTS COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) FLTS OF VERY LARGE GROUPS OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKING TEENAGERS NEED TO BE IDENTED AND MANNING FOR BOTH AGENTS AND CABIN CREWS SHOULD BE AT THE MAX WITH SPEAKERS FOR THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE. 2) IN THIS CASE; THE STATION STAFF MADE LITTLE OBSERVED ATTEMPT TO CTL THE AMOUNT OF CARRY-ON BAGS. THIS SHOULD BE STRICTLY CTLED ON FLTS THAT ARE BOTH FULL AND CONTAIN LARGE GROUPS WITH REDUCED LEVELS OF RULE COMPLIANCE. 3) THE TOUR OPERATORS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO EDUCATE THEIR GROUPS AS TO THE RULES AND THEIR SERIOUSNESS PRIOR TO FLYING. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR BUSINESS IS NOT WELCOME WITHOUT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONDUCT OF THEIR GROUPS. THEY SHOULD PROVIDE MORE CHAPERONES AND THEIR CHAPERONES SHOULD BE MORE FORCEFUL AND PROACTIVE. 4) MORE VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO IDENT NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS NEED TO BE MADE PRIOR TO SEATING THEM IN EXIT ROWS. THE RESPONSE OF 'SI' TO THE QUESTION; 'DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH' SHOULD BE A DISQUALIFIER; RATHER THAN A QUALIFIER FOR EXIT ROW SEATING. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR CLARIFIED WHAT HE MEANT WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT IDENTIFYING ENGLISH SPEAKERS PRIOR TO SEATING THEM IN EXIT ROWS BY ASKING; 'DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?'

WITH THAT; THE MAN ROSE UP SCREAMING; FLAILING; YELLING; ETC -- TOTALLY OUT OF CTL. ANOTHER PAX; MYSELF; AND THE FIRST PAX TRIED TO SUBDUE HIM. EVENTUALLY; 2 OTHER MALE FLT ATTENDANTS JOINED IN; MAKING A TOTAL OF 5 MEN TRYING TO HOLD THIS GUY DOWN; MOSTLY UNSUCCESSFULLY. AND THIS GUY WAS ABOUT 5 FT 5 INCHES AND PROBABLY 130 LBS. FOR THE NEXT 45 MINS OR SO; THE MAN WAS SCREAMING MOSTLY IN SPANISH; FLAILING AROUND; ETC. HAND RESTRAINTS WERE PUT ON HIM; BUT HE GOT LOOSE. FINALLY IT TOOK 2 PAX (VERY BIG GUYS); THE OTHER 2 MALE FLT ATTENDANTS (ALSO VERY BIG GUYS) TO TIE HIM UP IN SEATBELT EXTENSIONS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE MAN WHO FIRST NOTICED THE 'DISTURBED' PAX HAD PASSED OUT; BROUGHT THE RPTR BACK TO THE ROW OF SEATS WHERE HE WAS SEATED. THE MAN HAD PASSED OUT IN A KNEELING POS; ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIS SEAT. WHEN THE OTHER MAN SPLASHED WATER IN HIS FACE; HE WOKE UP IN A VIOLENT RAGE; SCREAMING OBSCENITIES IN SPANISH. THE RPTR THOUGHT THE MAN HAD BEEN DRINKING FROM HIS OWN BOTTLE. IT TOOK THE RPTR; 2 OTHER MALE FLT ATTENDANTS; AND 2 OTHER MALE PAX (INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL PAX) TO SUBDUE THE MAN. 2 OF THEM WRESTLED HIM TO THE FLOOR AND HANDCUFFED THE GUY WITH THE PLT'S HANDCUFFS. THE MAN WAS INCREDIBLY STRONG AND BROKE THE HANDCUFFS. IT TOOK AT LEAST 1/2 HR TO SUBDUE HIM AND TIE HIM TO THE SEAT WITH THE SEATBELT EXTENSIONS. THEY COVERED HIM WITH A BLANKET AND PROCEEDED ON TO SANTO DOMINGO. THE CAPT WAS GOING TO DIVERT; BUT THE MAN CALMED DOWN. INCREDIBLY; THE MAN DEPLANED WITH THE GND AGENTS AND THANKED THE FLT ATTENDANTS FOR THE 'NICE' FLT; AND EVEN COMPLIMENTED A FLT ATTENDANT ON HER PERFUME. THE POLICE ARRESTED HIM ON THE JETBRIDGE.

PAX GRABBED THE DRINK BACK FROM THE TRAY AND SAID 'ARE YOU CRAZY?' AFTER TKOF AND THE SEAT BELT SIGN HAD BEEN TURNED OFF; I STARTED TO SET UP THE MID GALLEY WITH FLT ATTENDANT #2; WHILE THE 4 FLT ATTENDANTS WORKING BUSINESS BEGAN THE INITIAL BEVERAGE SVC. FLT ATTENDANT #3 AND FLT ATTENDANT #_______ WERE WORKING THE COPLT SIDE OF THE ACFT. SHORTLY AFTER THE BEVERAGE SVC HAD BEGUN; FLT ATTENDANT #3 CAME TO THE GALLEY AND TOLD FLT ATTENDANT #1 AND MYSELF THAT THE GUY IN XH HAD JUST TOUCHED HER INAPPROPRIATELY. FLT ATTENDANT #3 WAS ALSO IN THE GALLEY AT THIS TIME AND FLT ATTENDANT #1 TOLD THEM IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED SHE WOULD GO AND TALK TO THE PAX. FLT ATTENDANT #3 AND I LOOKED AT THE DEP RPT TO SEE IF PAX WAS AN UPGRADED PAX; IT SHOWED HE WAS NOT AN UPGRADE. FLT ATTENDANT #3 THEN SAID TO ME; 'THIS GUY TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO GET PLASTERED TONIGHT;' AND I SAID 'NOT ON THIS FLT YOU'RE NOT.' A FEW MINS LATER; I TOOK THE TRAY SET UP CART TO THE FIRST CLASS GALLEY IN PREPARATION FOR THE MEAL SVC; AS I PASSED SEAT XH; PAX PATTED ME ON THE BACKSIDE 3 TIMES. I TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM; THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE LOOKED VERY SURPRISED AND HE IMMEDIATELY SAID 'I WASN'T GRABBING YOUR FANNY; I WASNT GRABBING YOUR FANNY.' I RESPONDED TO HIM BY SAYING; 'WELL THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO ME.' HE THEN RESPONDED BY SAYING AGAIN; 'I WASN'T GRABBING YOUR FANNY. I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO ANYBODY.' I CROUCHED DOWN BY PAX SEAT; AND HE CONTINUED TO TALK LOUD AND VERY FAST FOR SEVERAL SECONDS; I WOULD SAY 15-20 SECONDS. I EVENTUALLY INTERRUPTED AND ASKED; WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED. HIS RESPONSE WAS 'I WANT A JACK AND COKE IN THERE; AND A CHAMPAGNE IN THERE' POINTING TO 2 GLASSES ON THE TRAY TABLE;' AND 'I'M HUNGRY; I WANT SOMETHING TO EAT.' I EXPLAINED TO PAX THAT WE WOULD BE STARTING MEAL SVC SHORTLY; AND THEN SAID TO HIM 'I'M SORRY; BUT YOU'RE GIVEN ME THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK; AND WE WILL NOT BE SERVING YOU ANYMORE ALCOHOL ON THIS FLT.' PAX BECAME EVEN MORE AGITATED AT THIS AND SAID LOUDLY; 'I WANT A F...ING DRINK;' I EXPLAINED TO PAX THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET HIM A SOFT DRINK OR SOME JUICE; AGAIN HE SAID; 'I WANT A F...ING JACK AND COKE AND SOME CHAMPAGNE.' I REPEATED MYSELF; STATING; 'I AM NOT SERVING YOU ANY MORE ALCOHOL ON THIS FLT.' HE RESPONDED WITH 'LOOK I JUST WANT A DRINK. I'M SITTING HERE; I'M LOOKING AFTER MYSELF. I RESPONDED THAT I WAS LOOKING AFTER MYSELF; AND THAT IF HE LEAVES THIS FLT DRUNK; THEN IT IS NOT ONLY HIS PROB; BUT ALSO MY RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AT THIS POINT HE BECAME VERY LOUD AND ABUSIVE TOWARD ME YELLING 'I WANT A F...ING DRINK.' I STOOD UP AND SAID 'PAX; I AM NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND ARGUE WITH YOU. THERE IS NO NEED FOR FOUL LANGUAGE.' HIS RESPONSE WAS; 'IM' NOT F...ING ARGUING.' I CONTINUED TO SAY TO HIM; THAT HIS BEHAVIOR WAS GETTING TO BE THREATENING TO ME AND HE NEEDED TO STOP; YOU WILL NOT BE SERVED ANYMORE ALCOHOL AND THAT IS THE END OF IT. AT THIS POINT; PAX BECAME EVEN LOUDER YELLING 'THIS IS F...ING CRAZY; ALL I WANT IS A 'F...ING DRINK. JUST GET ME A F...ING DRINK.' I THEN LEANED TOWARDS HIM AND SAID 'LOOK I HAVE TOLD YOU; I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU; IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS; I WILL NOTIFY THE CAPT AND WE WILL LAND THE ACFT.' BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE HE INTERRUPTED AND SAID 'LAND THE F...ING PLANE IN BOSTON AND THROW ME OFF. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO BOSTON.' I REPLIED 'IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT WE'LL DO IT; BUT THE POLICE WILL MEET THE FLT AND YOU WILL BE ARRESTED.' AGAIN HE SAID LAND THE F...ING PLANE; I DON'T GIVE A F...' I RETURNED TO THE MID GALLEY TO RPT THIS TO FLT ATTENDANTS #3 AND #1 WAS IN THE COCKPIT TALKING TO THE CAPT ABOUT THE PROBS WE WERE HAVING; BY THIS TIME OUR SVC HAD BEEN DISRUPTED TO A GREAT EXTENT; AS FLT ATTENDANT #1 WAS DEALING WITH THE PROB I CONTINUED WITH MY DUTIES IN THE GALLEY. OUR SVC CONTINUED TO SUFFER AS I TRIED TO SET UP FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE BUSINESS CLASS CABIN AND NOT JUST MY DESIGNATED SIDE. FROM WHAT I REMEMBER AT THIS POINT. FLT ATTENDANT #4 AGAIN SPOKE TO PAX AND RECEIVED A SIMILAR RESPONSE AS I HAD. SHE DECIDED TO ISSUE PAX WITH A PAX DISTURBANCE RPT. FLT ATTENDANT #1 TOLD ME THAT THE CAPT SAID IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED THAT HE WOULD DIVERT AND LAND THE ACFT. THE NEXT INCIDENT I REMEMBER WAS FLT ATTENDANT #4 ASKING PAX IF HE WOULD LIKE AN APPETIZER. HIS RESPONSE WAS 'F... OFF; YOU F...ING BITCH; I BELIEVE.' FLT ATTENDANT #4 WALKED AWAY TOWARDS THE COCKPIT; BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WENT INTO THE COCKPIT. WHEN SHE CAME BACK; SHE MOVED PAST PAX TO THE NEXT ROW OF SEATS; AT THIS POINT HE BEGAN YELLING AGAIN AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE 'I WANT A F...ING DRINK; WHAT THE F...ING HELL IS GOING ON; I THEN SAW FLT ATTENDANT #4 GO OVER AND TALK TO PAX; AND HE WAS WITH HIM FOR QUITE SOME TIME; PROBABLY 5 MINS OR SO. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO START TO RUN OUT MAIN COURSES OR NOT AS IT WAS POSSIBLE WE WERE GOING TO DIVERT; BUT WORD CAME BACK FROM THE COCKPIT THAT AGAIN PAX WOULD BE GIVEN ONE MORE CHANCE TO CALM DOWN. WE HAD DELIVERED ABOUT HALF OF THE MAIN COURSES IN B ZONE; WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF PLATES SMASHING. I LOOKED DOWN THE AISLE AND SAW A COMMOTION AROUND PAX'S SEAT AS I WALKED UP THE AISLE I SAW FOOD ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND WAS TOLD PAX HAD THROWN HIS PATE FROM HIS TABLE. I RETURNED TO THE MID GALLEY; CAME BACK AND SAID START TO PUT THINGS AWAY WE ARE LNDG IN BANGOR. I STARTED TO PUT THINGS AWAY IN THE GALLEY AND FLT ATTENDANTS #1 AND #2 CAME TO ME AND SAID WE WERE GOING TO PUT RESTRAINTS ON PAX. THE 3 OF US WALKED TO PAX'S SEAT AND STOOD OVER HIM; HE WAS STILL VERY LOUD SWEARING AT CREW AND SURROUNDING PAX ALIKE. WHEN HE SAW THE RESTRAINTS HE STARTED SAYING 'WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO PUT THE F...ING HANDCUFFS ON ME; YEA GO ON PUT THEM ON.' AT THIS HE WOULD HOLD HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND HIS ARMS OUT AS IF TO LET US PUT THE RESTRAINTS ON HIM; BUT AS SOON AS WE TRIED TO PUT THEM ON HE WOULD SEPARATE HIS HAND AND BEGIN TO HIT AT US. AGAIN HE WOULD SAY 'PUT THE F...ING HANDCUFFS ON ME AND DROP ME OFF IN BOSTON.' A SCUFFLE THEN BROKE OUT AS FLT ATTENDANTS #4 AND #1 AND MYSELF TRIED AGAIN TO PUT THE RESTRAINTS ON PAX. WE STRUGGLED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE RESTRAINTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET STARTED. FLT ATTENDANT #4 TRIED TO HOLD DOWN HIS ARMS WHILE I TRIED TO HOLD HIS HANDS TOGETHER. WE EACH HAD A RESTRAINT; BUT WERE STRUGGLING TO GET THEM AROUND HIS WRISTS AND GET ONE FASTENED. IT WAS AT THIS TIME MY THUMB WAS PUSHED BACK BY PAX AND I SUSTAINED THE INJURY. I WAS LATER TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IN BANGOR. WE EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO GET ONE OF THE RESTRAINTS AROUND PAX'S WRISTS AND RESTRAIN HIS HANDS; WITH THE HELP OF A MALE PAX HOLDING PAX IN A HEADLOCK. AT THIS POINT PAX WAS IN HIS SEAT WITH HIS SEAT BELT FASTENED; STILL YELLING AND SWEARING AT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. I RETURNED TO MY GALLEY TO CONTINUE TO PUT THINGS AWAY FOR LNDG. THEN ONE OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS CAME RUSHING INTO THE GALLEY AND SAID YOU NEED TO GET OUT THERE; THAT GUY JUST HIT FLT ATTENDANT #4. I HURRIED OUT TO WHERE THERE WAS A GROUP OF MALE PAX STANDING OVER PAX; WHO WAS ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF SEATS XJ AND XH. THE PAX WERE VERY IRRITATED WITH PAX BY THIS TIME AND WERE TELLING HIM TO STAY DOWN AND JUST BE QUIET. HE CONTINUED TO YELL PROFANITY AT EVERYONE. I WAS THEN TOLD THAT PAX HAD RUSHED TOWARDS THE COCKPIT AND HIT FLT ATTENDANT #4 UNDER HIS CHIN KNOCKING HIS HEAD BACK. FLT ATTENDANT #4 THREW HIS ARMS UP TRYING TO PROTECT HIMSELF AND THE COCKPIT DOOR; NOT KNOWING IF PAX WAS TRYING TO FORCE HIS WAY INTO THE COCKPIT. SEVERAL MALE PAX HAD RESTRAINED PAX AND PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR AT SEATS XH AND XJ. PAX WAS STILL SHOUTING AND SWEARING 'LAND THE F...ING PLANE IN BOSTON; I DON'T GIVE A F... I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG; THIS IS F...ING CRAZY.' WE WERE THEN GIVEN THE SIGNAL FOR FINAL APCH. FLT ATTENDANT #4 WAS KNEELING OVER PAX'S ARMS AND I HAD HOLD OF HIS LEGS; WHICH WE HAD TIED TOGETHER WITH 2 LINENS; JAMMED UNDER SEAT XH. WE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED PUTTING PAX IN HIS SEAT; BUT FELT IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY TO PAX AND CREW MEMBERS; IT WAS SAFER TO DETAIN HIM WHERE HE WAS. I MADE SURE FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND MY JUMP SEAT POS WERE OCCUPIED FOR LNDG; A MALE PAX SAT IN PAX'S SEAT; IN CASE WE NEEDED ASSISTANCE ON LNDG OR TAXI IN. THIS WHOLE TIME; PAX WAS STILL YELLING PROFANITIES AND SAYING 'I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.' WE LANDED AND TAXIED TO THE GATE; WHERE SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS BOARDED THE ACFT AND TOOK PAX OFF THE ACFT. FLT ATTENDANT #4 WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI AT THIS TIME; PARAMEDICS CAME ONBOARD AND AFTER LOOKING AT FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND MYSELF; ADVISED US TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THEM. THE PARAMEDICS CALLED FORWARD TO THE HOSPITAL INFORMING THEM WE WERE ON OUR WAY AND IF POSSIBLE COULD THE DOCTORS RUSH US THROUGH; AS THE ACFT WAS GOING TO WAIT FOR US TO RETURN SO WE COULD CONTINUE ON TO MANCHESTER. AFTER BEING EXAMINED BY DOCTOR; I WAS SENT FOR X-RAYS OF MY L HAND. WHEN I RETURNED; DOCTOR CAME TO ME AND EXPLAINED THAT FLT ATTENDANT #4 NEEDED QUITE A FEW X-RAYS TO HIS JAW; AND FELT I SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO MANCHESTER; AND HE HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF CALLING OPS TO INFORM THEM NOT TO HOLD THE FLT FOR US; AS WE WERE NOT FIT TO CONTINUE. THE DOCTOR INFORMED ME I HAD HYPER-EXTENDED THE LIGAMENTS IN MY L THUMB. HE GAVE ME A BRACE TO WEAR FOR 7-10 DAYS AND SOME PAIN KILLERS. HE RECOMMENDED I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY OWN DOCTOR WHEN I RETURNED TO ATLANTA. THE NEXT MORNING I ALSO HAD PAIN IN MY R KNEE WHICH PROGRESSIVELY BECAME MORE PAINFUL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. I AM CURRENTLY ON OJI DUE TO THIS INCIDENT; AND HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY OWN DOCTOR. AN FBI AGENT CAME OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO INTERVIEW ME. THIS TOOK APPROX 45 MINS. WE LEFT THE HOSPITAL IN BANGOR AT XA35 AM; SUNDAY; AND DEADHEADED HOME VIA BOSTON SUN PM. WE WERE TOLD BY SEVERAL PAX WHILE ON THE GND IN BANGOR; THAT PAX HAD BEEN CAUSING PROBS AT THE CHK IN DESK AT THE GATE IN ATL PRIOR TO BOARDING AND 1 PAX TOLD ME PAX HAD BEEN REFUSED DRINKS IN THE CROWN ROOM OR A BAR IN THE ATL ARPT. AFTER BEING SENT TO A CLINC I WAS ADVISED TO HAVE AN MRI OF MY R KNEE. THIS TOOK PLACE ON JUN/XA/99. I HAD A SECOND VISIT ON JUN/XH/99; AND WAS ADVISED THAT SURGERY ON THE KNEE WOULD BE REQUIRED.

AS I WALKED BACK TOWARD THE GALLEY; I STOPPED AND ASKED THE MAN SITTING IN THE 'B' SEAT OF THE EXIT ROW IF IT BOTHERED HIM TO SIT NEXT TO THE MAN AND IF HE NOTICED HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOR. HE SAID HE WAS PROBABLY THE BEST PERSON TO SIT THERE BECAUSE HE HAD A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER THAT WAS AN ALCOHOLIC; AND HE WAS USED TO DEALING WITH AN INTOXICATED PERSON. I CONTINUED TO GET MY MEAL CART AND ROLL IT BACK UP THE AISLE; WHEN I NOTICED THE PAX RIGHT BEHIND ME AS SOON AS I HAD STOPPED.

THE CAPT INTERPED IT TO MEAN THAT ALL THE FEMALE FLT ATTENDANTS IN THE BACK WERE ON THE RAG! A MALE PAX ASKED ME ABOUT THE REAR EXIT DOOR AND MENTIONED HE WAS A PLT IN THE MIL. I ASKED HIM IF WE HAD A PROB WITH A PAX; WOULD HE MIND HELPING. HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME HE KNEW THE PAX WAS A PROB OUTSIDE THE GATE BEFORE BOARDING. HE SAID HE WAS AT THE BAR ACROSS FROM GATE IN DALLAS AND OFFERED TO BUY A LOT OF THE MEN GOING ON HIS FLT TO LOS ANGELES A DRINK. AT THE BAR; HE PULLED OUT A 'HUGE' SWITCH BLADE ABOUT 18 INCHES LONG AND THREATENED THAT IF ANYONE TRIED TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM; THEY'D BE HURT BAD. I IMMEDIATELY INFORMED THE CAPT. LATER; A PAX ACROSS THE AISLE FROM THE PROB PAX SAID HE SAW HIM TAKE THE KNIFE OUT OF HIS BAG AND MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH; LIKE HE WAS SHARPENING IT -- ALL THE WHILE MAKING THREATENING REMARKS ABOUT THE FLT ATTENDANTS.

AFTER THE FACT; THE PLTS LATER BACKED UP THE FLT ATTENDANTS COMPLETELY. THE MIL PLT; WHO WAS TALKING TO THE MAN; TOLD HER THAT THE MAN WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC; AND THAT THE ALCOHOL ONLY EXACERBATED HIS CONDITION. THEY DID NOT SERVE HIM LIQUOR ON THE PLANE; BUT DID CATCH HIM TRYING TO STEAL LIQUOR FROM THE GALLEY.

MANY PAX WERE UNAWARE THAT DRINKING FROM ONE'S OWN BOTTLE IS PROHIBITED. THERE WERE SEVERAL PAX WHO SAW THIS; BUT SAID NOTHING. PERHAPS SOME EDUCATION ON THIS RULE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE MAN NEVER DID ZIP HIS PANTS UP; BUT PASSED OUT WITH THEM UNZIPPED. UNITED STATES CUSTOMS; IMMIGRATION AND THE POLICE ENTERED THE PLANE IN BOSTON TO ARREST THE MAN; WHO WAS LED OFF IN HANDCUFFS. THE CASE HAS ALREADY GONE TO TRIAL; AND SHE SAID IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 'TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE.' THE JUDGE WAS SO LENIENT THAT IT AMOUNTED TO A 'SLAP ON THE HAND.' EVEN THOUGH THE MAN EXPOSED HIMSELF; ASSAULTED A FLT ATTENDANT (BY THROWING A SUITCASE AND HITTING HER IN THE CHEST); AND DRANK OUT OF HIS OWN BOTTLE; AND PLEADED GUILTY; THE JUDGE HAD HIM SEND A LETTER OF APOLOGY TO THE 2 FLT ATTENDANTS INVOLVED; FINED HIM AND LET HIM GO! SHE WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE JUDGE DID NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND FEELS THAT THESE FARS HAVE NO TEETH IN THEM; IF THE JUDICIAL SYS JUST SLAPS THE OFFENDER ON THE HAND LIKE THIS. SHE FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THE AIRLINES DON'T MAKE THE FACT THAT DRINKING OUT OF ONE'S OWN BOTTLE ON THE AIRPLANE IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE PUBLICLY DISPLAYED AS SUCH. SHE SUGGESTS THAT SIGNS BE POSTED AT CHK-IN COUNTERS; DUTY FREE SHOPS; AND ON THE BACK OF THE TICKET WALLETS; EXPRESSING THIS AS A FEDERAL OFFENSE. SHE SAID AT PARTIES WITH NON FLYING FRIENDS; THAT MOST EVERYONE IS UNAWARE THAT THEY CAN'T DRINK FROM THEIR OWN BOTTLE. IF THE PUBLIC WAS MORE INFORMED; MAYBE OTHER PAX WOULD RPT IT TO THE FLT ATTENDANTS WHEN THEY SEE IT HAPPEN IN THE CABIN. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 453338: ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT; SEEING THE BOTTLE ON THE FLOOR; WAS ABLE TO GET IT AND TOOK IT TO THE AFT GALLEY. PAX IN ROW Y WERE MOVED. THE PROB PAX; LOOKING FOR HIS BOTTLE; THEN THREW HIS CARRY-ON BAG AT THE FLT ATTENDANT. HE STRUCK HER IN THE CHEST. CAPT WAS MADE AWARE. WHILE WAITING FOR THE CAPT; THE PAX URINATED ON THE FLOOR UNDER ROW Z. HE THEN GOT BACK TO HIS SEAT AND LAID DOWN WITH HIS LEGS IN THE AISLE. AS I WAS TELLING HIM TO LAY DOWN IN THE SEATS (4 SEATS) HE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO ME. DURING THE TIME WE WERE MOVING OUR PAX; BOTH MYSELF AND THE OTHER FLT ATTENDANT WERE VERY CALM; BUT VERY FRIGHTENED OF WHAT HE MIGHT DO. HE WAS A VERY LARGE; VERY DRUNK MAN. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SIT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN LHR. PAX ASKED THE MAN NEXT TO HIM IF HE CARED IF HE HAD A DRINK OUT OF HIS OWN BOTTLE.

I WAS FLT ATTENDANT #5 FROM JFK TO PAP ON AUG/XA/99. WE ARRIVED LATE FROM JFK. WHEN WE ARRIVED IN PAP; WE WERE INFORMED THAT OUR ACFT WAS TO BE USED FOR THE PAP-MIA TRIP WHICH HAD BEEN DELAYED FROM THE DAY PRIOR. WE HAD A DECISION ON OUR ACFT OF XA00 LCL TIME; AWAITING PARTS AND MECHS FROM MIA. ONCE THEY ARRIVED WE WENT TO THE TERMINAL TO WAIT. DURING THIS TIME; WE WERE TOLD THAT IF WE LEFT; WE WOULD NOT BE CATERED -- NO WATER WOULD BE ADDED; AND NO ICE WOULD BE BROUGHT ON -- THERE WOULD BE NO WATER IN THE LAVATORIES AS WELL. AT APPROX XA00; WE ALL WENT BACK TO THE ACFT AND BEGAN BOARDING ABOUT 15 MINS LATER. PAX WERE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY CAME ON; ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY FOUND OUT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CATERING OR WATER ONBOARD. THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS AT ALL IN THE TERMINAL. AFTER ALL THE PAX WERE ONBOARD; WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WOULD BE RECEIVING SANDWICHES AND SODAS IN A SHORT WHILE. A SHORT TIME TURNED INTO A LONG TIME. PAX STARTING HITTING CALL LIGHTS; WANTING TO KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER. I WAS IN THE AFT CABIN WITH THE 4L DOOR STILL OPEN WITH AIRSTAIRS ATTACHED. AT APPROX XA00; ABOUT 2 HRS AFTER BOARDING; I SAW A WHOLE CROWD OF PEOPLE STANDING AND YELLING INCITING A RIOT. AT THAT POINT; CALL LIGHTS WERE GOING OFF ONE AFTER THE OTHER. AT THAT POINT; I WAS FEELING UNEASY IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE; BUT THE 4L DOOR WAS STILL OPEN; SO I FELT LIKE I COULD STILL GET OUT IF I NEEDED TO. THE SHOUTING UP FRONT CONTINUED TO WORSEN. I WENT INTO THE CABIN FOR A MIN TO LISTEN TO A PA THE CAPT WAS MAKING; TELLING EVERYONE TO SIT DOWN OR WE WEREN'T LEAVING UNTIL THEY DID SO. NO ONE LISTENED -- IT ONLY INCITED THEM FURTHER. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE REAR; THE 4L DOOR WAS CLOSED AND STAIRS REMOVED. THE SHOUTING WAS PERSISTENT WITH MORE PEOPLE STANDING. AT THAT POINT; I WAS FEELING TRAPPED AND UNSAFE IN THE AFT CABIN. I DECIDED TO MOVE UP TO THE FORWARD PART OF THE ACFT; WHERE I FIGURED THE REST OF THE CREW WAS. I FOUGHT MY WAY THROUGH THE CROWD; YELLING; PUSHING AND CLBING OVER BAGS. I FELT A LITTLE BIT BETTER ONCE I WAS WITH THE REST OF THE CREW IN THE FORWARD GALLEY; CLOSER TO AN OPEN DOOR. THE CAPT WAS NOT DOING MUCH AT THIS POINT TO CTL THE SIT; EXCEPT MAKE LOUD REMARKS SO THAT FIRST CLASS COULD HEAR; LIKE 'IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE; SCREW 'EM.' THE CROWD DID NOT RELENT. I EXPRESSED MY FEELINGS TO THE CREW THAT I DID NOT FEEL SAFE ONBOARD THE ACFT. MANY OTHERS EXPRESSED THE SAME. AT THIS POINT THE CAPT WAS ON THE MEGAPHONE -- TELLING EVERYONE TO CALM DOWN; THAT THE FOOD WOULD BE THERE ANY MIN. THAT SEEMED TO GET THEM EVEN ANGRIER. THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT 20 MINS; WHEN THE PURSER SAID HE NO LONGER FELT SAFE AND WAS LEAVING THE ACFT. AT THAT POINT; I SAID; I NO LONGER FELT SAFE ONBOARD AND I TOLD THE CREW AND THE CAPT THAT I WAS LEAVING. HE WAS STILL TALKING ON THE MEGAPHONE AND HAD NO CTL OVER THE SIT. FLT ATTENDANT #2 AND MYSELF WAITED ON THE RAMP BY THE GATE AREA -- 3 OTHER FLT ATTENDANTS CAME OUT ALSO AND SAID THEY DID NOT FEEL SAFE ON THE ACFT (THIS ALL HAPPENED ABOUT XA30 LCL TIME). THE FLT ATTENDANTS THEN CAME OUT; SAID IT WAS STILL OUT OF CTL ONBOARD. THE GND STAFF WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE US TO GO BACK ONBOARD SO THE FLT COULD LEAVE. A FEW MINS LATER THE CAPT MADE A PLEA TO FLT ATTENDANT #2 OVER THE MEGAPHONE TO RETURN TO THE ACFT AND SPEAK WITH HIM -- WE DID NOT GO BACK -- FEELING IT WAS STILL UNSAFE. SHORTLY AFTER THAT ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT CAME OUT AND SAID IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER ONBOARD. ALL BUT FLT ATTENDANT #2 AND MYSELF RETURNED TO THE ACFT. EVERYONE KEPT TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT IT WAS SAFE. THE DOOR TO THE ACFT SOON CLOSED AND STAIRS PULLED AWAY -- READY TO DEPART. WE WERE INSIDE THE TERMINAL AND ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE IN GETTING A HOTEL AND TRANSPORTATION. ABOUT 10 MINS LATER; A MGR CAME AND TOLD FLT ATTENDANT #2 THAT SHE WAS CONFIDENT THAT IT WAS SAFE FOR US TO RETURN. FLT ATTENDANT #2 HAD FLOWN WITH HER MANY TIMES AND TRUSTED HER JUDGEMENT. AT THAT POINT I DECIDED IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR ME TO STAY IN PAP BY MYSELF AND I OPTED TO RETURN TO THE ACFT. AFTER I RETURNED TO THE ACFT; FLT ATTENDANT #5 TOLD ME THAT WHEN THE CAPT RETURNED ONBOARD AFTER HE TRIED TO CONVINCE ME AND FLT ATTENDANT #2 TO RETURN; HE SAID IN FRONT OF THE CREW AND THE FO THAT; 'THOSE TWO @#%^&$* $#%^*@# ARE STAYING.' I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO THE CAPT ABOUT THIS STATEMENT OR ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. I CONTINUED TO PERFORM MY DUTIES AS A FLT ATTENDANT THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP. THE LAVATORIES AND THE REAR GALLEY WERE DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY -- THERE WAS NO RUNNING WATER IN THE LAVATORIES FOR THE 3 1/2 HR FLT TO JFK; PLUS THE 2 1/2 HRS ON THE GND WITH PAX ONBOARD. I FEEL THAT MY SAFETY AND WELL BEING WAS COMPROMISED BY ACR X AIRLINES; REPRESENTED BY CAPT AND THAT I WAS VIEWED IN A DISCRIMINATORY FASHION BY ACR X AIRLINES IN THE COMMENT EXPRESSED BY CAPT.

THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT CALLED THE COCKPIT AND INFORMED THEM OF THE SIT. WE COULD NOT FIND THE SOURCE OF THE SMELL. THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT OPENED THE COCKPIT DOOR AND TOLD THEM WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE GATE AND HAVE THE CABIN CHECKED OUT. THE CAPT MADE A PA THAT WE WERE GOING BACK TO THE GATE.

THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT TOOK THE PAX TO THE FORWARD PART OF THE ACFT. HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS PANTS; AS IF HE HAD A WEAPON. A FEW MINUTES WENT BY AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TAKE THIS PAX OFF THE ACFT; SO HE WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT.

WE MADE OUR REQUIRED ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE BAGGAGE PRIOR TO BOARDING AS WELL AS ON THE ACFT; YET WE UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR EVERYONE'S CARRY-ON LUGGAGE. ABOUT 5 MINS BEFORE DEP; I COULD HEAR SOMEONE YELLING LOUDLY FROM THE BOARDING DOOR. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF ENCOUNTERING MR X WHO WAS VERY UNRULY; DEMANDING; AND THREATENING! HE WAS SHAKING; SWEATING; SWEARING AND REFUSING TO CHK HIS BAG! HE WAS CURSING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE OUR AIRLINE WAS AND INSISTING ON WANTING EVERYONE'S NAME AND EMPLOYEE NUMBERS; INCLUDING THE GATE AGENTS AND ENTIRE CREW. HE PUT HIS FINGER IN MY FACE AND SWORE THAT IF I CHKED HIS BAG; IT WOULD BE ALL OF OUR JOBS! HE WAS EXTREMELY VOLATILE WITH THE #6 FLT ATTENDANT. I DID AT THIS TIME CONFIDE IN THE CAPT THAT THINGS WERE VERY HECTIC AND WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH A DIFFICULT PAX; BUT FELT THE SIT WAS UNDER CTL! PAX X FINALLY SAT DOWN AND CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN AND YELL UNTIL AFTER TKOF! HE REMAINED RELATIVELY QUIET DURING THE FLT; BUT INTERFERED WITH ME DISARMING MY DOORS IN THE FIRST CLASS GALLEY UPON DEPLANING. BECAUSE OF HIS LARGE SIZE AND AGGRESSIVE NATURE; I FELT VERY INTIMIDATED WITH HIM STANDING IN FRONT OF ME. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD MY BOSS ON THE PHONE AND THAT HE WANTED MY NAME AND EMPLOYEE NUMBER. I WROTE BOTH MY NAME AND EMPLOYEE NUMBER ON A PIECE OF PAPER; HANDED IT TO HIM AND REQUESTED THE SAME FROM HIM! HE REFUSED. I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DID INDEED HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PHONE; THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH THEM; OR THEY WERE WELCOME TO CALL ON ME ON MY LAYOVER. HE THREW UP HIS HANDS AND STORMED PASSED ME; ALMOST KNOCKING ME OVER AND YELLING ABOUT HIS BAG! THE REASON I FEEL CONCERN FOR THIS PAX IS BECAUSE OF HIS VIOLENT AND EXPLOSIVE DISPLAY OF EMOTION TOWARDS THE AGENTS; MYSELF; MY FELLOW CREW MEMBERS; THE OTHER 175+ PAYING PAX ON THE AIRPLANE. MY REAL REASON FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE THIS IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE IS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING; AND HE WILL TAKE ANYONE DOWN WITH HIM IN ORDER TO GET IT! I DID INFORM THE CAPT OF THE SIT WHILE DEPLANING AND HE APOLOGIZED FOR NOT REMOVING HIM BEFORE DEP. I PERSONALLY FELT WE COULD HANDLE HIM; AND THAT IS WHY I DID NOT ESCALATE THE SIT WITH THE CAPT. HE TOLD ME HE WOULD BE AVAILABLE; IF I NEEDED BACKING. I ONLY REGRET 1 DECISION I MADE CONCERNING THIS SIT.

APPARENTLY; THE DISTURBED PAX HAD BEEN MOVED TO THE LAST ROW (ACFT R) OF THE AIRPLANE; IN AN ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE HIM FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS. 1 FLT ATTENDANT REMAINED IN THE REAR OF THE ACFT (WITH 2 ADDITIONAL OFF-DUTY FLT ATTENDANTS IN PLAIN CLOTHES) AND A MIL OFFICER IN UNIFORM. THE PERSONS JUST MENTIONED WERE SEATED AROUND PAX X AS INCONSPICUOUSLY AS POSSIBLE; IN EFFORT TO KEEP HIM UNDER SUPERVISION; BUT NOT TO ALARM HIM. WE WERE TOLD BY THE FLT ATTENDANTS THAT PAX X WAS HALLUCINOGENIC AND THAT HE WAS UPSET; BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER PAX HAD SHOWN HIM A KNIFE AND HAD THREATENED HIS LIFE. HE SEEMED VERY PARANOID AND WAS SEEING AND HEARING VARIOUS THINGS. HE WAS RPTED TO ALSO SEE A DEAD BLEEDING PAX IN THE AISLE AND ALSO THAT HE SWORE THE ACFT WAS ON FIRE. PAX X WAS DUCKING AND DODGING IMAGINARY PUNCHES FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE (AS IF HE WERE FIGHTING SOMEONE). WITH THAT INFO THE CAPT SAID TO KEEP PAX X ISOLATED AND TO GIVE HIM SPACE (WHICH THE FLT ATTENDANTS HAD ALREADY DONE) AND ALSO TO KEEP US (THE PLTS) INFORMED. A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO DISPATCH INFORMING THEM OF A POSSIBLE PROB PAX. APPARENTLY; HIS BEHAVIOR WORSENED AS WE CONTINUED. HE BEGAN RANDOMLY SHOUTING TO IMAGINARY PEOPLE AND WAS EXTREMELY WORRIED THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM. AS THE FLT PASSED OVER DEN; THE CAPT AND I HAD REVIEWED COMPANY POLICY ABOUT DISRUPTIVE PAX. WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO BOTH REMAIN UP IN THE FLT DECK; SO THAT IF PAX BECAME VIOLENT; WE REMAINED TO GET THE ACFT ON THE GND. WE ALSO DISCUSSED OPTIONS AND SCENARIOS INCLUDING DIVERTING. WE ASKED THE FLT ATTENDANTS OVER DEN IF THINGS WERE BECOMING WORSE AND INTRODUCED THEM TO THE OPTION OF A DIVERT TO ANOTHER ARPT TO LEAVE HIM WITH POLICE. WE DECIDED TO TRY AND CONTINUE THE TRIP SINCE PAX X HADN'T BECOME VIOLENT OR MADE ANY VERBAL THREATS TO THE CREW. THE CAPT CONTINUED TO ADVISE THE DISPATCHER VIA ACARS TO KEEP COMPANY ADVISED OF THE SIT. HE STEADILY BECAME MORE INSISTENT ON LEAVING THE ACFT AND TRIED TO LEAVE HIS SEAT TO GO TO THE REAR L2 AND R2 DOORS TO FORCE HIS WAY OUT OF THE PLANE. HE WAS RESTRAINED BY THE MIL OFFICER. PAX X WAS DEATHLY AFRAID OF WHOEVER WAS 'THREATENING' HIM. HE YELLED OUT; 'CAN'T YOU SEE THEM? THEY'RE STARING AND GRINNING AT ME. THEY WAS TO KILL ME.' HE WAS STILL SEEING THE ACFT ON FIRE; PAX WANTING TO KILL HIM AND TAUNTING HIM. PAX X SAW GUNS AND KNIVES AND JUST WANTED OFF. IT SEEMED TO US THAT THE SIT WAS DETERIORATING SO WE MADE THE DECISION TO DIVERT TO MCI. THE CAPT COMMUNICATED WITH DISPATCH IN THE DSCNT TO GET THE NECESSARY COM UNDER WAY TO MCI ARPT; MCI POLICE; AND COMPANY PERSONNEL TO PREPARE A GATE FOR US. ATC WAS EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING. NO VIOLENT ACT WAS COMMITTED SO NO EMER DECLARATION WAS MADE. THE CAPT WAS INFORMATIVE BUT VAGUE IN HIS ARR BRIEFING TO THE PAX (SO AS TO NOT ALARM PAX X). HE ALSO REQUESTED THAT ALL PAX REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS ONCE AT THE GATE. THIS WAS TO ALLOW POLICE ACCESS TO THE REAR OF THE ACFT ASAP. I FLEW A NORMAL VISUAL APCH TO RWY 19L. ONCE ON THE GND; PAX X TRIED TO GET UP OUT OF HIS SEAT AND AGAIN HAD TO BE RESTRAINED BY THE MIL OFFICER. WE PARKED AT GATE X ON THE X CONCOURSE AFTER FOLLOWING A 'FOLLOW ME' TRUCK.

THE MCI STATION MGR TOLD ME IN THE JETWAY THAT PAX X WAS A PROFILED PAX; AND WE FOUND HIS BOARDING CARD IN HIS SEAT BACK POUCH.

SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE 4L LAV AND THAT THE INTERPHONE WAS BUSY TO THE COCKPIT; SO ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT WAS GOING TO THE COCKPIT TO STOP PUSHBACK AND GET ASSISTANCE. I LEFT MY DOOR; AS THERE WAS ONLY 1 FLT ATTENDANT IN THE AFT GALLEY. I GOT THE HALON FROM THE 4R DOOR AREA AND AFTER SEEING AND SMELLING SMOKE; FIRED IT INTO THE LAV TRASH CONTAINER. THE FLT ATTENDANT IN THE GALLEY AREA TOLD ME THAT GALLEY LIQUIDS HAD NOT STOPPED THE SMOKE. AFTER USING THE HALON; I RETURNED TO MY DOORS AT 3R; AS A PLT AND OTHER FLT ATTENDANTS HAD REACHED THE AREA. THE PLT OPENED THE COMPARTMENT AND WAS SATISFIED THE PROB WAS SOLVED AND THE FLT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY. PRIOR TO SMELLING SMOKE IN THE LAV; A FLT ATTENDANT HAD SMELLED TOBACCO SMOKE ON A PAX EXITING THE LAV DURING BOARDING. HOWEVER; ANOTHER PAX ENTERING THE LAV OBSTRUCTED THE VIEW; SO SHE WAS UNABLE TO IDENT THE PERSON. THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY WITH THIS INCIDENT WAS THE INABILITY TO CONTACT THE COCKPIT QUICKLY. THE PHONE SYS ON THE B777 ONLY ALLOWS FOR ONE AT A TIME CONVERSATIONS; UNLIKE OTHER OF OUR AIRLINE'S PHONES WHICH HAVE A PARTY LINE. WITH ANY OTHER PLANE AT AIRLINE X; THE AFT FLT ATTENDANTS COULD HAVE RUNG 4 CHIMES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PLANE AND ALL FLT ATTENDANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE SIT; AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT. ONE FLT ATTENDANT WOULD HAVE REMAINED ON THE INTERPHONE; WHILE ANOTHER WOULD HAVE FOUGHT WHAT WE BELIEVED WAS A FIRE. THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT MY DOOR. BUT; BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLT ATTENDANT AT THE PROB; AND IT APPEARED TO BE A FIRE; I THOUGHT IT BEST TO LEAVE MY DOOR AND GO AFT. THIS WASN'T AN EASY DECISION; AS MY DOOR AREA WAS LEFT UNATTENDED. I BELIEVE THE INTERPHONE SYS ON THE B777 IS A SAFETY HAZARD. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE SMOKE ALARM NEVER SOUNDED; NOR DID THE TRASH BIN FIRE EXTINGUISHER ACTIVATE. THE SMOKE IN THE LAV WAS THICK ENOUGH THAT ONE COULD NOT SEE ONESELF IN THE MIRROR. IT WAS THE RELIEF PLT WHO CAME BACK AND PULLED THE TRASH CONTAINER OUT TO MAKE SURE THE FIRE WAS OUT. THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY CHARRED REMAINS OF A FIRE. THE RPTR SAID THAT THERE IS NO OVERRIDE ON THE COM SYS; EITHER TO THE COCKPIT OR TO THE PURSER. ON ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF ACFT IN THEIR FLEET; 4 CHIMES SIGNALS THE COCKPIT AND OTHER FLT ATTENDANTS OF AN IMMEDIATE EMER. THE INTERCOM ON THE B777 DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THIS; SO THE CALLS FROM THE CABIN ARE QUEUED UP ON THE PLT'S SCREEN; AND ANSWERED BY THEM IN THE ORDER RECEIVED. THE RPTR BELIEVES THAT THEY WERE LUCKY IN THIS SIT; WHERE FLT ATTENDANTS HAD TO LEAVE THEIR DOORS UNATTENDED; THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PAX INITIATED EVAC. IN ADDITION TO NOT HAVING AN OVERRIDE FOR CALLING THE CAPT; WHEN THE FLT ATTENDANTS ARM THEIR DOORS; THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO CALL THE PURSER AND NOTIFY HER/HIM THAT THE DOORS ARE ARMED. THEY CAN'T DO THIS; BECAUSE THE PHONE LINE IS BUSY. CONSEQUENTLY; THE FLT ATTENDANTS HAVE RESORTED TO ANNOUNCING OVER THE PA THAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL DOOR IS ARMED.",,,,"CAB RPT; B777; NRT-SEA.

OUT OF 10000 FT; ONE OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS CALLED AND SAID SHE WAS PRETTY SURE THERE WAS A BOMB IN A BAG. I WENT BACK TO THE REAR TO TAKE A LOOK. IT WAS A DARK GREEN; DIRTY BAG; WHICH SHE HAD OPENED. INSIDE WAS A TIMER; A DEVICE WITH CIRCUITRY ON IT AND WIRES LEADING FROM THE TIMER TO THIS DEVICE. THERE WAS AN OBJECT UNDERNEATH THE TIMER THAT LOOKED LIKE A SMALL PACK WRAPPED IN CLOTH OR PAPER. THERE WAS A WHITE HAIR DRYER THAT SEEMED TO BE ASSEMBLED; BUT NOT CORRECTLY. I TOLD THE FLT ATTENDANT 'THAT'S A BOMB; WE'LL GO BACK.' I QUICKLY WENT TO THE COCKPIT AND TOLD THE CAPT. WE WERE 36.5 DME FROM SEA ON THE SUMMA 5 DEP TRACKING THE 143 DEG RADIAL. THE CAPT WAS TALKING TO ATC; GETTING A RETURN TO SEA. I CALLED DISPATCH AND TOLD THEM WE WERE RETURNING; LNDG IN JUST OVER 5 MINS; WE HAD A POTENTIAL BOMB ON BOARD. THERE WAS A MODERATE RAINSHOWER 7-10 MI OUT ON FINAL TO RWY 34R AT SEA. I REQUESTED THE CFR TRUCKS. THE 'B' FLT ATTENDANT CALLED AND ASKED IF WE WANTED THE BOMB IN THE TAIL CONE -- THE LEAST RISK AREA ON THE MD80. OUR CABIN ALT WAS 2100 FT AND WE WERE ABOUT 3 MINS FROM LNDG. I ASKED THE CAPT IF HE WANTED IT IN THE TAILCONE. HE SAID NO. HE SAID LATER HE THOUGHT THAT I WAS REFERRING TO A PRESSURE SWITCH ON THE BOMB; BUT I WAS REFERRING TO THE FACT WE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THE CABIN. THE 'B' FLT ATTENDANT ZIPPED UP THE BAG AND PUT IT UNDER THE SEAT. ABOUT 2 MI OUT; I COULDN'T SEE ANY CFR TRUCKS. GND TOLD US TO CROSS OVER TO THE W SIDE AND FOLLOW THE PORT OF SEA VAN. WE WANTED TO STOP AND EVAC AS SOON AS WE CROSSED; BUT FELT LIKE WE WOULD TAKE ANOTHER 30 SECONDS AND TAXI ALL THE WAY TO THE 'BOMB SPOT.' WE CAME TO A STOP; I RAN THE EVAC CHKLIST AND WHILE THE CAPT HELPED THE 'A' FLT ATTENDANT OPEN THE FRONT DOOR. I STOOD UP TO HELP WITH THE STAIRS; WHICH STILL WEREN'T READY. 5 SECONDS LATER THE CAPT COMMANDED; 'EVAC.' THE 'B' FLT ATTENDANT OPENED THE FORWARD GALLEY DOOR R1; AND POPPED THE SLIDE. I SHOUTED AT THE PEOPLE COMING OUT THE AIRSTAIRS TO MOVE AWAY FROM AIRPLANE. I WENT BACK TO L2 AND HELPED PEOPLE DOWN THE SLIDE. I ENLISTED ANOTHER MAN TO GATHER THE OTHERS WHO WERE RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD. I RAN INTO 2 OTHER FLT ATTENDANTS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR THE 6 YR OLD UNACCOMPANIED MINOR. AT THIS TIME; THE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS WERE TAKING CTL OF THE SIT. I TALKED TO THE POLICE TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE BOMB DEVICE AND TELL THEM WHERE IT WAS LOCATED; BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE 'B' FLT ATTENDANT HAD PUT IT UNDER THE SEAT. THE POLICE HAD TROUBLE LOCATING THE DEVICE. WE WENT WITH THE PAX TO THE TERMINAL TO BE QUARANTINED. I FLEW THE NEXT DAY; AS DID THE CAPT. THERE WERE 2 MINOR INJURIES. THE CONSENSUS WAS THE EMER AND SUBSEQUENT EVAC WAS HANDLED WELL. THE DECISION TO USE THE STAIRS FIRST; PROBABLY WAS OUR BIGGEST MISTAKE. WE SHOULD HAVE EVACED THROUGH ALL THE DOORS. WE LATER LEARNED THAT SINCE WE ADVISED THE FLT ATTENDANTS THAT WE WOULD USE THE STAIRS; BUT STANDBY FOR A FULL EVAC; THEY DISARMED THE DOORS. WHEN THE CAPT CALLED FOR THE EVAC; THE 'C' FLT ATTENDANT OPENED L2 AND WAS LOOKING DOWN AT THE GND WITH NO SLIDE. WE HAD 2 FLT ATTENDANT TRAINEES ON BOARD WHO HELPED AND; IN FACT; 1 TRAINEE WENT TO THE TAILCONE IN THE DARK AND RELEASED THE TAIL AND KICKED OVER THE SLIDE; WHICH HADN'T DEPLOYED. THEY BOTH HELPED PEOPLE EVAC THROUGH THE TAILCONE. THE WHOLE EVAC TOOK LESS THAN 90 SECONDS. MANY PAX GRABBED THEIR CARRY-ONS; WHICH CREATED A BIG PILE IN THE COCKPIT AND SPILLING OUT INTO THE CABIN. NO ONE WOULD LEAVE THEIR LAPTOP ON BOARD. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE PAX IN THE QUARANTINE AREA. SEVERAL PAX CAME UP TO US TO TALK; AND SOME WERE ANGRY WITH US. I DID NOT HEAR THE CAPT DECLARE AN EMER. THE BOMB WAS ACTUALLY A DEVICE MADE TO LOOK LIKE A BOMB. IT WAS USED BY A SECURITY COMPANY TO TEST THE SECURITY SCREENERS AT SEATAC. THE PERSON CONDUCTING THE TEST LOST CTL OF THE BAG AND A PAX PICKED UP THE 'WRONG' BAG AND PUT IT WITH AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR (FAMILY). THE 2 OF THEM WENT TO THE GATE AND THE ADULT PAX SENT THE MINOR ON THE AIRPLANE BY HIMSELF; AS AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR; WITH A 'BOMB.' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE UNACCOMPANIED MINOR WANTED HIS CRAYONS AND THEN HE SAID 'THAT'S NOT MY BAG.' THE FLT ATTENDANT LOOKED IN IT AND DISCOVERED THE 'BOMB.' THE CAPT MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WERE TURNING AROUND AND GOING BACK TO SEATTLE; BECAUSE OF SUSPICIOUS MATERIAL FOUND. AFTER THE DEBRIEFING; SOME PAX WERE UPSET THAT THEY WEREN'T DIRECTLY TOLD IT WAS A BOMB. THE RPTR ALLEGES THAT THE PROB OF NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE FRONT DOOR'S STAIRS WAS CAUSED BY THE FLT ATTENDANT; IN HER PANIC; FORGETTING TO CRACK THE DOOR OPEN FIRST; AND THEN RELEASING THE STAIRS. THE FO RECKONS THAT HE WAS HIT ABOUT 6 OR 7 TIMES WITH CARRY-ON ITEMS THAT THE PAX WERE TRYING TO TAKE WITH THEM; BEFORE THE FLT ATTENDANT PUSHING PEOPLE OUT NOTICED; AND GOT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN PREVENTING THE PEOPLE JUMPING WITH THEM IN HAND. AT THE DEBRIEFING LATER; THE RPTR WAS TOLD THAT WHEN THE SECURITY COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE RUNNING THE TEST DISCOVERED THE BACKPACK WAS TAKEN; THEY PURPORTEDLY MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE TERMINAL. IN THE RPTR'S MIND; THEY SHOULD HAVE SHUT DOWN THE ARPT IMMEDIATELY; UNTIL THEY FOUND THE BAG. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF INFLT SVCS LATER WENT AND WATCHED THE VIDEO OF THE BAG GOING THROUGH THE X-RAY MACHINE; THE SECURITY ATTENDANTS NOTICING IT; AND THEN; DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING; LET IT GO ON THROUGH; WHERE IT WAS PICKED UP BY THE BOY'S GUARDIAN.

AT THAT MOMENT; FLT ATTENDANT #7 CAME INTO THE COCKPIT; TELLING THE CAPT THAT THE PAX WAS CLAIMING TO HAVE DYNAMITE WITH HIM AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO BLOW UP THE ACFT. I SAT WITH THE PAX DURING THE RETURN TO JFK; SO I COULD KEEP HIM CALM; WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND FRIGHTENING. WE LANDED AND THE COPS TOOK OVER.

THE SPANISH-SPEAKING RPTR SAID THAT HE HAD MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN SPANISH; THAT ALL DUTY FREE BOTTLES OF LIQUOR BOUGHT AT THE ARPT WERE NOT TO BE CONSUMED INFLT; AND THAT IF THEY WERE CAUGHT; THE BOTTLES WOULD BE CONFISCATED. WHEN THE MAN THREATENED THE RPTR WITH DEATH IF HE DIDN'T BRING HIM ANOTHER BOTTLE; THE RPTR TRIED TO PACIFY HIM; BY TELLING HIM TO HAND OVER HIS BOTTLE AND HE WOULD REFILL IT. AFTER THE BOMB THREAT WAS MADE AND THEY TURNED AROUND TO GO BACK TO JFK; A DEADHEADING PLT IN THE COCKPIT OFFERED TO GO BACK AND SIT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAN FOR LNDG. THE PLT AND THE RPTR GOT THE MAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS FAMILY; AND HE TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIST AND THAT HE WAS WORKING ON AN ATOMIC BOMB TO BLOW UP THE WORLD. WHEN THE MAN GOT UP TO USE THE LAVATORY AT 10000 FT; THE PLT JUMPED UP AND FOLLOWED HIM. AFTER HE CAME BACK TO HIS SEAT; THE RPTR THOROUGHLY INSPECTED THE LAVATORY. WHEN THEY LANDED IN NEW YORK; THE MAN THOUGHT HE WAS IN SANTO DOMINGO; HIS DEST; EVEN AFTER THE ARREST WAS MADE! 6 POLICEMEN CAME ON BOARD TO TAKE HIM OFF. THE MAN THAT WAS HIT WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE. 4 FEDERAL AND 3 STATE CHARGES WERE FILED AGAINST THE SUSPECT. THE RPTR'S SAFETY SUGGESTION IS THAT DUTY FREE LIQUOR NOT BE SOLD ON FLTS TO SANTO DOMINGO; OR CONNECTING TO SANTO DOMINGO; BECAUSE ON EVERY FLT; AT LEAST 11 BOTTLES ARE CONFISCATED BY THE CREWS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 464245: HE DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. I WAS ONE OF THE SPANISH SPEAKERS ONBOARD; SO I APCHED THE PAX AND NOTICED THE BOTTLE WAS MORE THAN 1/2 EMPTY. I ADVISED HIM THIS WAS AGAINST FARS; AND HE SAID HE DID NOT CARE. I ALSO TOLD HIM HE COULD GO TO JAIL FOR THIS AND HE LAUGHED AND SAID HE LIKED JAIL; THEN PUT THE BOTTLE BTWN HIS LEGS AND TOLD ME TO TRY AND TAKE IT. THE PAX GOT VERY ROUGH WITH THIS FLT ATTENDANT AND OFFERED TO 'BREAK HIS FACE' IF HE DID NOT SERVE HIM A COCKTAIL.

SHE DEPOSITED BAGS AT THE END OF ZONE A. SHE RAN TO THE AFT OF ACFT; HID IN LAVATORY; SEATED HERSELF AFT OF PLANE IN SLEEPING POS. SHE WENT ON IN A GREEN DRESS WITH HAIR UP.

SHE WAS REMOVED WITH HER BAGS AT THE GATE. AN AGENT MGR BOARDED THE ACFT AND ASKED QUESTIONS AND DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD BE REMOVED. WHY WAS IT EVEN A QUESTION? MOST CERTAINLY SHE WAS A SECURITY RISK. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT; APPARENTLY; A CUSTOMS AGENT HAD RUSHED AFTER THE WOMAN FROM CUSTOMS; BECAUSE SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM COSTA RICA; AND SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM CHK OR LOOK IN HER BAG. THIS AGENT THEN TOLD THE AIRLINE'S GATE AGENT NOT TO BOARD HER. THIS WAS THE DISCOURSE TAKING PLACE IN FRONT OF THE RPTR WHILE SHE WAS TAKING TICKETS. THE RPTR SAID THAT THE WOMAN MUST HAVE CHANGED CLOTHES ON THE JET BRIDGE; BECAUSE SHE DID NOT GET ON IN THE ORIGINAL GREEN DRESS; BUT IN A SWEAT SUIT; WHICH WAS WHY THE FLT ATTENDANTS AND POLICE COULDN'T FIND HER.

STATEMENT OF CAPT. AT NO TIME DID THE CAPT HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE DISRUPTIVE PAX. APPROX 4 HRS INTO THE FLT; FLT ATTENDANT #1 CAME TO THE COCKPIT TO RPT A PROB WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF FREQUENT FLYER PAX XY; SEATED IN SEAT Y. MY FLT ATTENDANT'S DEMEANOR AND TONE OF DELIVERY IN HER DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNT CONVINCED ME OF A GENUINE FEARFUL DEEP CONCERN OF THE IMPENDING SIT. WITH REF TO SECTION X OF THE FLT OPS MANUAL; THE FLT ATTENDANT ISSUED THE PAX NOTICE OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL REG VIOLATION. THIS EXPERIENCED FLT ATTENDANT CLAIMED THE PAX: DISREGARDED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE WARNING; DISPLAYED BELLIGERENT AND IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR WHICH EXTENSIVELY DISTURBED OTHER PAX; HAD AT ONE POINT EARLIER IN THE FLT 'CORNERED' HER ALONE IN THE GALLEY; APPEARED TO SUDDENLY BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS AS THE PAX WAS 'NON-DESCRIPT' DURING BOARDING AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLT; PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN THESE NON-NORMAL ACTIONS AND DISPLAYS OF IRRATIONALITY; DISRUPTED THE ENTIRE FIRST CLASS SECTION THUS CREATING AN UNCOMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE OF APPREHENSION AND FEAR AMONG OTHER PAX IN THE CABIN. THESE FACTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THE FO; WHOSE REST PERIOD WAS BROUGHT TO AN ABRUPT AND PREMATURE END; WITNESSED EVENTS WHICH ENSUED REQUIRED HIS INTERVENTION AS AN ACTIVE CREW MEMBER. DESPITE IMMEDIATE INVOLVEMENT; THE FAILURE OF FO'S ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE THE EXCHANGE AND BRING RESOLUTION OF THE INCIDENT; HE RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT. HE RPTED TO ME A DEEP CONCERN THAT THIS PAX DEMONSTRATED A PATTERN OF UNSTABLE BEHAVIOR. MY FO RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT OBVIOUSLY SHAKEN AND DISTRAUGHT WITH THE EXPERIENCE HE JUST ENCOUNTERED IN FULL VIEW OF THE ENTIRE FIRST CLASS SECTION. THE PAX WAS SEATED NEXT TO HIS OWN BROTHER. THIS PAX HAD ALREADY ACHIEVED CATEGORY 2 STATUS AS DESCRIBED IN XX OF THE FLT OPS MANUAL AND WAS NEARLY ELIGIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED A CATEGORY 3 CRIMINAL SECURITY PROB. THIS WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE ACTIONS OF THE PAX WHO: 1) INTERFERED WITH THE FLT ATTENDANT'S DUTIES BY CAUSING THEM TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT VIGILANCE ON HIS POS WITHIN THE ACFT AT ALL TIMES AND 2) MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR COCKPIT CREW MEMBERS TO ENGAGE IN THEIR ALLOWED; ANTICIPATED AND DESIRED REST PERIODS AND 3) DIVERTED THE CAPT'S ATTN FROM ROUTINE DUTIES TO ONE OF STRATEGIZING A COURSE OF ACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY PROCS AS STATED IN THE FLT OPS MANUAL. THE COCKPIT CREW BRIEFED THE FLT ATTENDANTS THAT AT LEAST 1 FLT ATTENDANT CREW MEMBER WAS TO BE STATIONED AT THE COCKPIT DOOR AND BE POSITIONED TO PREVENT A COCKPIT INCURSION FOR THE DURATION OF THE FLT. PLTS AGREED THAT THE CRASH AX AND FIRE EXTINGUISHER WERE 2 METHODS OF RESTRAINING OR INCAPACITATING THE PAX IN THE EVENT OF A COCKPIT INCURSION. THE THREAT REQUIRED THE CREW TO DISCUSS A LNDG AT THE NEAREST SUITABLE ARPT AND CITED BOSTON LOGAN ARPT AS AN ACCEPTABLE ARPT. MESSAGES WERE SENT TO THE DISPATCHER VIA ACARS AND THE DECLARATION OF A CTLED CATEGORY 2 SECURITY SIT WAS RELAYED TO COMPANY. THE BROTHER VOLUNTEERED THAT THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING PRIOR TO EMBARKATION AND HINTED STRONGLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE PILLS PROBABLY WERE THE CULPRIT OF THE SIT. THE BROTHER HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF PILLS WERE TAKEN NOR WAS HE AWARE OF ANY MEDICAL CONDITION REQUIRING HIS BROTHER TO TAKE MEDICATION. DURING THIS TIME THE COCKPIT CREW DEVELOPED A STRATEGY WHICH INCLUDED A FIRM DECISION POINT TO DIVERT TO BOSTON IN THE EVENT THE PAX'S BEHAVIOR BECAME MORE PHYSICAL OR UNCONTROLLABLE. EVERYONE AGREED THE POTENTIAL THREAT OF A PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION WAS STRONG; AS EXHIBITED BY THE PAX'S AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. IN MY GALLEY DISCUSSION WITH THE BROTHER WHO REQUESTED THE MEETING; I MADE IT CLR THAT THE ACFT WAS GOING TO BE MET BY AUTHS AT EITHER BOSTON OR PHILADELPHIA AND SHOWED HIM THE FLT OPS MANUAL PAGES WITH HIGHLIGHTED PORTIONS JUSTIFYING MY DECISION. THE CREW REST SEAT NOW WAS RENDERED UNUSABLE BY THE CREW. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT WAS STRESSFUL FOR CREW AND PAX ALIKE. THEDISRUPTIVE PAX REMAINED AWAKE AND TALKED; OFTEN LOUDLY; WITH HIS BROTHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT. IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RPTED TO ME THAT A TRIP TO THE RESTROOM RESULTED IN THE PAX VOMITING. THE POLICE OFFICER RPTED ANOTHER VOMITING EPISODE ON THE JETWAY. AT NO TIME WAS THE VIGILANCE OF THIS PAX'S BEHAVIOR RELAXED BY THE CREW. THE ACFT WAS MET BY AUTHS WHO REMOVED THE PAX PRIOR TO DEPLANING. I WAS ASKED IF I STILL WANTED TO 'PRESS CHARGES' AND I AGREED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. AS POLICE ESCORTED THE PRISONER OFF THE AIRPLANE; A SHOE-BOX-SIZED CARTON OF CUBAN COHIBA CIGARS DROPPED FROM THE COAT OF THE PRISONER WHICH TRIGGERED THE POLICE TO NOTIFY CUSTOMS OFFICIALS. DEPLANING PAX EXPRESSED GRATITUDE AND RELIEF TO THE POINT OF HUGGING AND EMBRACING THE FLT ATTENDANTS UPON DISEMBARKATION ONCE THE POLICE REMOVED THE DISRUPTIVE PAX. THIS PAX CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF TERROR AND FEAR FOR PAX AND CREW ALIKE FOR NEARLY 4 HRS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE MAN NEVER FELL ASLEEP THE WHOLE FLT; AND THAT IS WHY HE WANTED A FLT ATTENDANT TO GUARD THE COCKPIT DOOR FOR THE REST OF THE FLT. THE MAN CALLED THE FO; THE PURSER; AND THE PAX ACROSS THE AISLE VERY ABUSIVE 'F' NAMES; AND THREATENED THEM. THE CAPT WAS VERY UNEASY WITH THE MAN'S BROTHER; WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE'D TRY AND HELP THE CREW QUIET HIM DOWN; BUT SAID 'I'M HIS BROTHER; BUT I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM.' THE CAPT WASN'T SURE THE BROTHER HAD ALSO TAKEN SOME DRUGS; SO HE COULDN'T BE TRUSTED. THE FLT DID NOT DIVERT TO BOSTON; BUT WENT AHEAD AND LANDED IN PHILADELPHIA.

I ASKED THESE 2 WOMEN THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: 'ARE EITHER OF YOU DRINKING BEER?' THEIR RESPONSE WAS 'NO.' I THEN ASKED; 'DID YOU BRING YOUR OWN ALCOHOL ON BOARD THE ACFT?'

AT THIS TIME I DID SMELL THE ODOR OF BEER IN THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS OF SEATS X AND Y; BUT THE ODOR WAS SO STRONG THAT I COULD NOT PINPOINT THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE BEER CANS. I NOTICED THAT BOTH WOMEN EXHIBITED BEHAVIORS COMMON TO THOSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL; FOR EXAMPLE; SLURRED SPEECH AND LOSS OF MOTOR CTL.

THEY WERE INTERFERING WITH OUR DUTIES; AS WELL AS THE MEAL SVC. I RESPONDED TO A PAX CALL LIGHT IN THE VICINITY OF THE PAX IN X AND Y. THE SUSPECTED INTOXICATED INDIVIDUALS USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CALL ME OVER TO THEIR ROW. THEY ASKED ME WHY WE WOULD NOT SERVE THEM ALCOHOL. I RESPONDED WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS: 'OUR AIRLINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF ITS PAX AND IT WOULD BE UNSAFE TO SERVE YOU ALCOHOL WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN AN EXIT ROW; AND YOU ARE SEEMINGLY ALREADY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL.' THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET ME TO IGNORE THE SAFETY ISSUES INVOLVED WITH SERVING THEM ALCOHOL BY TELLING ME A SAD STORY ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN FOR THEM. I TOLD THEM THAT I STILL COULD NOT SERVE THEM ALCOHOL. WHEN ALL OF THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET ALCOHOL FROM ME FAILED; THEY BECAME MORE ANGRY AND EVEN ABUSIVE. AT THIS POINT THE PAX IN X AND Y BEGAN TRYING TO INTIMIDATE ME. THEY MADE THREATS ABOUT ME LOSING MY JOB BECAUSE I WOULDN'T SERVE THEM ALCOHOL. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE SPECIAL CUSTOMERS WHO HAD BEEN ESCORTED TO THE ACFT BY SOMEONE NAMED MR UU WHO WORKED FOR OUR AIRLINES. (MR UU IS PROBABLY A PAX SVC AGENT IN MIAMI.) THEY WERE TOO INTOXICATED TO REMEMBER HIS LAST NAME THOUGH. THE PAX IN X ACTUALLY GRABBED MY SHIRT AND TIE AND PULLED ME DOWN TOWARDS HER FACE IN ORDER TO TELL ME THAT I WAS AN 'IDIOT;' ALONG WITH SOME OTHER FOUL REMARKS. THEY WERE YELLING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES AND OTHER PAX WERE VISIBLY SHAKEN AND DISTURBED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE PAX IN SEAT X AND Y. I WALKED TO THE SVC KIT AND PULLED OUT THE PAX RPT.

AFTER THE BEVERAGE SVC; I WAS PASSING HIS ROW. HE SAID HE DROPPED SOMETHING AND WANTED TO GET RID OF IT. THE NEXT THING HE WAS SHOVING SEVERAL THINGS ONTO A TRAY I WAS HOLDING. THE PURSER HAD SERVED HIM 1 DRINK. I THEN WENT UP TO FIRST CLASS AND TALKED WITH OUR PURSER AND TOLD HER HE SHOULDN'T BE SERVED ANY MORE DRINKS. HE HAD OBVIOUSLY HAD A LOT MORE TO DRINK PRIOR TO OUR FLT. (I SMELLED IT DURING THE LAST CONVERSATION WITH MR X.) PAX Y (WOMAN) HAD ALREADY SPOKEN ABOUT HER CONCERNS WITH THE PURSER.

I WENT BACK TO FIRST CLASS AND PAX Y (WOMAN) FOLLOWED.

AFTER ARRIVING AT THE GATE; RAMP PERSONNEL BROUGHT UP HIS WHEELCHAIR TO THE FRONT DOOR; WHERE CUSTOMER SVC SUPVRS WERE WAITING FOR HIM TO DEPLANE. HE IGNORED THEM; AND RAPIDLY MOVED UP THE JETWAY; FASTER THAN THE SUPVRS COULD WALK. HE ROLLED RIGHT INTO THE POLICE; WHO WERE STANDING AT THE TOP OF THE JETWAY.

THE FO ALSO CAME OUT TO ASSIST AND RESULTED IN BEING VERBALLY ATTACKED ON JETBRIDGE AND GATE AREA. THE PAX ACTED STRANGE WITH A NASAL PROB DURING THE FLT. HE WAS DRINKING VODKA. A FLT ATTENDANT SAW WHITE POWDER ON THE LAVATORY COUNTER AFTER THE PAX USED IT. THE PAX SAT IN COACH DURING THE FLT AND CAME BACK TO SEAT. AFTER LNDG GEAR WENT DOWN; HE DROPPED HIS BAG IN AISLE. FLT ATTENDANT TOLD HIM TO PUT IT IN THE OVERHEAD BIN. HE GOT DEFENSIVE AND SAID HE WAS PUTTING IT UNDER HIS SEAT. FLT ATTENDANT #1 SAID 'OK; OK;' THEN WENT BACK TO HER JUMP SEAT.

HE WENT BACK AFTER THE LNDG GEAR LOWERED AND ALL THE FLT ATTENDANTS WERE STRAPPED IN. IT WAS THIS CONFRONTATION WITH THE BAG IN THE AISLE IN FIRST CLASS THAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR HIS SUBSEQUENT BIZARRE BEHAVIOR ON THE JETBRIDGE.

'AIR RAGE' INCIDENTS ARE BECOMING AN EVER INCREASING PROB IN THE ACR INDUSTRY. THERE IS VERY LITTLE; IN THE WAY OF PROCEDURAL INFO TO ADVISE CREWMEMBERS ON HOW TO HANDLE THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. I SUGGEST BOTH FAA AND ACR OPERATORS FORM SOME TYPES OF PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES TO AID IN 'AIR RAGE' INCIDENTS. SUCH AS; RESTRAIN DEVICES; SEQUENTIAL CHECKLISTS OF ITEMS THAT MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED FOR ABNORMAL OPERATION; SUCH AS PAX HANDLING; SECURITY; MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL; FBI; COMPANY CONTACTS; PAPERWORK; CATERING; NTSB; ETC. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE PARTICULAR NOTE OF ATC HANDLING DURING THE ABOVE INCIDENT. I NOTIFIED ATC THAT I HAD A SIT OCCURRING ABOARD MY ACFT THAT MAY NECESSITATE AN IMMEDIATE DIVERSION TO A 'SUITABLE ALTERNATE ARPT.' THE ATC CTLR SAID STANDBY; AND CONTINUED TO TALK TO OTHER ACFT ON ANOTHER FREQUENCY. SECONDS WENT BY WITH NO RESPONSE. I DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND REQUESTED CLRNC DIRECT TO ANC. THE CTLR DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE MY EMERGENCY IN ANY WAY; INSTEAD HE CONTINUED TALKING TO OTHER ACFT ON ANOTHER FREQUENCY. THIS PARTICULAR CTLR DID NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE OR CONCERN REGARDING OUR EMERGENCY SIT. I WAS ON MY OWN. IN ALL MY YEARS OF FLYING; I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED THIS LACK OF CONCERN FROM ATC. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THREE DIFFERENT TIMES; FLT ATTENDANTS CAME TO THE COCKPIT APPRISING THEM OF THE VOLATILITY OF THE SIT; AND EACH TIME HE TRIED TO GET THE CTLR'S HELP; BUT THE CTLR APPEARED TO SHOW NO CONCERN FOR THE URGENCY OF THE SIT. FINALLY; HE TOOK MATTERS IN HIS OWN HANDS AND DECLARED AN EMERGENCY. EVEN THEN; IT STILL APPEARED; THAT THE CONTROLLER WASN'T TOO INTERESTED IN HIS PROB. THE RPTR CLAIMS THE CTLR NEVER REALLY PROVIDED ANY TYPE OF ASSISTANCE OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOR THE EMERGENCY. HE DECLARED THE EMERGENCY ONLY AFTER HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT; NOT ONLY HAD TWO FLIGHT ATTENDANTS BEEN 'SLUGGED' BY THIS WOMAN; SHE WAS NOW ATTACKING ELDERLY PAXS BY HITTING THEM IN THE FACE WITH A FULL CAN OF BEER. THE FLT ATTENDANTS NEEDED ONE OF THE PLTS TO COME BACK; IMMEDIATELY; TO HELP. THE RPTR SENT THE FIRST OFFICER AND A PLT JUMP SEATER BACK TO HELP. ACCORDING TO WHAT THE FLT ATTENDANTS TOLD HIM LATER; THE FRACAS STARTED WHEN THE WOMAN AND HER MALE COMPANION WERE ARGUING LOUDLY AND A FLT ATTENDANT ASKED THEM TO KEEP THE NOISE DOWN; THEN THE WOMAN SLUGGED HER. WHEN THE FIRST OFFICER WAS TRYING TO SUBDUE HER; SHE BIT HIM ON THE HAND AND ARM; BREAKING THE SKIN. THE SMALL WOMAN WAS EXTREMELY STRONG.

THE CAPT RADIOED AHEAD FOR OUR AIRLINE SECURITY TO MEET THE FLT AND TALK TO THE WOMAN. NO SECURITY WAS AVAILABLE; AND NO FBI; SO THE LCL POLICE WERE WAITING FOR US ON THE JETBRIDGE.

SHE PUT ON HER SUNGLASSES (IT WAS MIDNIGHT) AND WALKED OFF NONCHALANTLY.

THE CREW ALL GATHERED AFTER DEPLANING AND SHE PLEADED IGNORANCE. WE DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES AND LET HER GO.

THE OTHER PAX CHEERED AS SHE WAS LED OFF. THE REASON THEIR OWN AIRLINE SECURITY DIDN'T MEET THE FLT WAS THAT IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT AND NO ONE WAS AROUND. AFTER THE POLICE INTERROGATED HER; SHE ASKED TO SEE THE CREW TO APOLOGIZE AND BEG THEIR FORGIVENESS. THE CREW DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES; BECAUSE ALCOHOL WAS NOT A FACTOR AND SHE DIDN'T HURT ANYONE.

HE WAS UNABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON MY QUESTIONS OR GIVE A CLR RESPONSE. A PA WAS MADE FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. THE LAVATORY WHICH HE UTILIZED WAS SOILED WITH VOMIT IN THE SINK.

THE EMT PERSONNEL TOOK A BRIEF LOOK AT HIM AND IMMEDIATELY SENT HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. I PUT THIS MAN IN THE FORWARD FLT ATTENDANT JUMP SEAT FOR 3 REASONS: 1) TO ALLOW THE FLT ATTENDANT TO GIVE HIM ATTN UNTIL WE LANDED. 2) TO ISOLATE HIM FROM OTHER PAX IN CASE HE MAY HAVE A CONTAGIOUS ILLNESS. 3) TO HAVE HIM AT THE FRONT DOOR SO THAT THE EMT'S COULD SEE HIM IMMEDIATELY UPON LNDG.

I BASED MY RECOMMENDATION ON THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME WE WERE APPROX OVER FT WAYNE; IN; ONLY ABOUT 150 MI FROM CVG AND WE WERE AT THE TIME ABOUT 50 MI EARLY ON OUR ETA INTO LAX. HE CALLED THE DISPATCHER WHILE I FLEW. THE DISPATCHER CONCURRED AND WE BEGAN THE DIVERT WITH ME STILL FLYING. THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT MADE A PA THAT WE WERE DIVERTING INTO CVG. AT THIS POINT; THIS PAX KNEW WE HAD CALLED HER BLUFF; AND RAN TO THE COCKPIT DOOR AND TRIED BANGING ON IT TRYING TO GET IN. A MALE FLT ATTENDANT SUBDUED HER AND ESCORTED HER TO A COACH SEAT WHERE SHE SAT FOR THE REST OF THE FLT. I MADE A PA TELLING THE PASSENGERS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ACFT; BUT THAT DUE TO AN UNRULY PAX WE HAD TO DIVERT TO CVG FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THE CREW'S SAFETY.

UPON ARR; POLICE AND SECURITY MET THE PLANE AND SHE DEPLANED. IN THE JETWAY; SHE TOLD POLICE THAT SHE HADN'T UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS THE PLT; AND THAT WE WERE ALL MEAN; AND FURTHER; THAT SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TOLD US SHE WOULD GO BACK TO HER SEAT. ALL OF WHICH; OF COURSE; WAS FALSE. THEY LATER TOOK HER AWAY IN A SQUAD CAR. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: AFTER HIS CONFRONTATION WITH THE WOMAN; HE WANTED TO DIVERT AND ASKED THE CAPT. THE CAPT WAS VERY HESITANT; BUT SAID IF DISPATCH AGREED WITH THE FO; THEN THEY WOULD DIVERT. WHEN THE RPTR MADE THE PA THAT THEY WERE DIVERTING TO CVG TO TAKE OFF A DISRUPTIVE PAX; THE WOMAN LEFT HER SEAT AND CAME RUNNING UP TO THE COCKPIT DOOR AND WAS TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN. THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT DIDN'T HEAR OR SEE IT HAPPENING; BECAUSE SHE WAS BUSY PUTTING THINGS AWAY IN THE GALLEY; SINCE THEY HAD ONLY 15 MINS TO PREPARE THE CABINS FOR LNDG. IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT THE MALE FLT ATTENDANT WAS ON THE L AISLE AND COULD SEE WHAT THE WOMAN WAS TRYING TO DO. HE ACTUALLY TOOK HER FORCIBLY BACK TO HER SEAT; AND SAT NEXT TO HER FOR THE REST OF THE FLT; INCLUDING; ALLEGEDLY; LNDG. WHEN THEY LANDED; THE WOMAN LITERALLY TRIED TO RUN OFF THE PLANE BEFORE ANYONE COULD CATCH HER. INSTEAD; SHE SPRINTED OFF THE PLANE ONLY TO LAND IN THE ARMS OF 1 OF THE 4 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WAITING ON THE JETWAY.

WHEN WE REACHED THE CREW VAN; THE POLICE WAS THERE AND TOOK RPTS FROM THE PAX AND FLT ATTENDANT #9. PAX WAS BELLIGERENT AND EMOTIONALLY OUT OF CTL. (SCREAMING AND YELLING AT POLICE OFFICERS; CREW MEMBERS; ETC.) SHE DEMANDED THAT POLICE TAKE ACTION AND IF THEY DID NOT; SHE WOULD FOLLOW US; BECAUSE AS SHE STATED; 'SHE HAD A PERSONAL AGENDA WITH FLT ATTENDANT #9.'

CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE WOMAN HAD A CELL PHONE/PAGER. SHE WAS ACCUSING FLT ATTENDANT #9 (MALE) OF ASSAULTING HER; BECAUSE HE TOOK AWAY HER CELL PHONE; EVEN THOUGH HE GAVE IT BACK TO HER AFTER TKOF. THE PURSER DIDN'T THINK THE WOMAN WAS SUCH A THREAT; SO SHE DIDN'T CALL FOR THE POLICE TO MEET THE PLANE. THE CAPT; FLT ATTENDANT #9 AND THE WOMAN ALL WENT INTO THE POLICE STATION. THE WOMAN TRIED TO PRESS CHARGES AND WANTED THE FLT ATTENDANT'S ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER. THE MALE FLT ATTENDANT WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE WOMAN FINDING OUT WHERE HE LIVED.

I WENT BACK TO ASK THE VIP PERMISSION TO LOOK INSIDE THE CASE AND HE AGREED. (HE WAS DRESSED IN A 3 PIECE SUIT AND HOLDING A 6 MONTH OLD BABY AND HIS WIFE BESIDE HIM.) I FOUND 2 VERY LONG AND SHARP CARVING KNIVES IN THE BIG SET; BUT THE VIP'S DIDN'T WANT TO LET THE SET OUT OF THEIR POSSESSION. I SAID NO TO THE COCKPIT STORAGE IDEA; THEN A FLT ATTENDANT SAID TO PUT THE 2 KNIVES IN HER CREW BAG AND PUT IT IN THE CARGO PIT AND RETRIEVE AT THE END OF THE FLT; WHICH SOUNDED SAFE TO ME. BUT THE NEXT DAY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT BY GIVING THE KNIVES BACK TO THE PAX ON THE LOADING BRIDGE AT THE END OF THE FLT; I WAS ALLOWING THE KNIVES BACK INTO A SECURE AREA AND THEY COULD GET ON ANOTHER FLT UNDETECTED. I FORGOT TO ADD: HOW DID THEY GET THROUGH SECURITY AT THE DEP ARPT? THEY TOLD THE SAME STORY TO SECURITY AND SECURITY CALLED A PORT AUTH. THE POLICEMAN WHO CARRIED THE UTENSIL BOX AND ESCORTED THE PAX ON THE AIRPLANE AND HANDED THE BOX TO A FLT ATTENDANT WHO WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE FLT ATTENDANT WHO TOLD ME.

WHILE DOING A CABIN CHK AFTER BOARDING AT MSP; ONE OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS RPTED THAT A PERSON WHO APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DRINKING WAS SEATED IN AN EXIT ROW; SEAT XD. THE LEAD FLT ATTENDANT RPTED THIS TO ME. I SUGGESTED SHE MOVE HIM; BUT HE BECAME UNCOOPERATIVE. I SPOKE PERSONALLY WITH THE PAX; MR X. I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD BEEN DRINKING. HE SAID YES. AT THE TIME I SPOKE TO HIM; HE APPEARED TO BE IN CTL OF HIS FACULTIES. HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO HIS SISTER'S FUNERAL AND THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN IN A MAJOR AUTO WRECK. HIS LEG HURT HIM BADLY FROM THE WRECK. THAT IS APPARENTLY WHY HE WAS SEATED AT THE EXIT ROW. I PROPOSED THAT HE SIT IN ANOTHER (NON EXIT ROW) LOCATION FOR TKOF AND LNDG; AND THAT DURING FLT HE COULD SIT AT THE EXIT ROW TO REST HIS LEG. THAT WAS AGREEABLE TO EVERYONE. WE PUSHED BACK; TAXIED OUT; BUT WERE DELAYED FOR A LONG TIME DUE TO HVY OUTBOUND TFC. DURING OUR SIT AT THE RWY 12L DEICE PAD/TXWY COMPLEX; THE LEAD FLT ATTENDANT CAME UP AND SAID THE SAME PAX WAS OUT OF HIS NEW SEAT AND HAD RESEATED HIMSELF AT THE EXIT ROW; CLAIMING THAT WE WERE ALREADY AIRBORNE (WHICH WE WERE NOT). WHILE SHE WAS ON THE FLT DECK; WE ALL HEARD ARGUMENT NOISES COMING FROM THE PAX CABIN. THE #1 LEFT IMMEDIATELY. FLT ATTENDANT #2 CAME FORWARD; SOBBING. SHE SAID SHE HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH THE DISRUPTIVE PAX. I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEATED IN THE COCKPIT TO RECOVER HER COMPOSURE; AS SHE WAS CRYING HARD; VISIBLY UPSET. I ASKED FO YY TO INFORM MSP GND CTL THAT WE WOULD NEED TO REMAIN PARKED AT OUR PRESENT LOCATION FOR A FEW MINS; AS WE HAD PAX UP IN THE CABIN. THE BRAKE WAS CHKED SET AND I TURNED THE ACFT OVER TO FO YY. NUMEROUS PEOPLE WERE STANDING -- CREW AND PAX -- AS I ENTERED THE CABIN. I ONCE AGAIN ASKED THE LEAD FLT ATTENDANT TO HAVE THE DISRUPTIVE PAX SEATED AWAY FROM THE EXIT ROW. I ASKED THE ARMED CORRECTIONS ESCORT; MR Y; WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED MYSELF TO EARLY IN THE BOARDING PROCESS; TO MONITOR THE DISRUPTIVE PAX WHILE WE RETURNED TO THE GATE. I MADE A VERBAL REQUEST TO THE OTHER PAX AND CREW TO BE SEATED AND TOLD THEM WE WOULD RETURN TO THE GATE. THE SIT WAS CALMING DOWN. AS WE WALKED FORWARD; I ASKED LEAD FLT ATTENDANT #1 TO SECURE THE CABIN FOR TAXI TO THE RAMP. UPON RETURN TO THE COCKPIT; I ASKED THE FO TO REQUEST SECURITY AND A FLT ATTENDANT SUPVR TO MEET THE ACFT; AND CLRNC FROM GND CTL TO RETURN TO GATE X. FLT ATTENDANT #2 WAS STILL VISIBLY SHAKEN; SO I ASKED HER TO REMAIN IN THE JUMP SEAT FOR THE TAXI BACK TO THE GATE. WE PARKED NORMALLY AND ARPT POLICE MET THE ACFT ALONG WITH GND AGENTS. THE DISRUPTIVE PAX WAS REMOVED WITH HIS CABIN BAG. HE WAS APPARENTLY QUESTIONED BY MSP POLICE AND A RPT TAKEN. WHILE WAITING FOR THE INFLT OFFICE REPRESENTATIVE TO ARRIVE (THEY APPARENTLY WERE IN A MEETING); I CONSOLED FLT ATTENDANT #2; MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PAX; AND HAD FO YY COORDINATE OUR FUEL/PAX LOAD WITH MR Z IN DISPATCH. I ASKED FLT ATTENDANT #2 IF SHE WANTED TO CONTINUE ON. SHE ELECTED TO REMAIN IN MSP. WE GAVE A SHORT BRIEFING TO THE PAX ABOUT WHAT HAD OCCURRED; RAN CHKLISTS; AND DEPARTED FOR SMF. I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED FROM PAX VERBAL COMMENTS AND WRITTEN AFFIDAVITS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THIS RPT; THAT FLT ATTENDANT #2 ACTED TOTALLY IN A DEFENSIVE MANNER. THIS PAX HAD MOVED IN A VERY HOSTILE; VERBALLY ABUSIVE AND THREATENING MANNER TOWARDS NOT ONLY HER PERSONALLY; BUT ALSO THE FORWARD CABIN AND COCKPIT PORTION OF THE ACFT.

WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE GATE; THE AIRLINE SECURITY AND POLICE GOT ON TO ARREST HIM. HE VERBALLY ABUSED THEM AS WELL. THE MAN WAS ARRESTED AND SPENT A FEW NIGHTS IN JAIL.

ATC WAS MOST ACCOMMODATING. BOTH FLT ATTENDANTS NOW GOT INTO THE ACT; MOVED EVERYONE AWAY FROM HIM AND DID A SUPERB JOB OF TALKING TO THE OFFENDING PAX; KEEPING HIM AS CALM AS POSSIBLE. IT IS THE FLT ATTENDANTS WHO DID A MARVELOUS JOB OF KEEPING THIS SIT FROM GROWING TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF VIOLENCE. SINCE THE FLT ATTENDANTS SEEMED TO HAVE A CALMING EFFECT ON THE PAX; AND WE WERE JUST ABOUT IN THE TERMINAL AREA; I DECIDED AGAINST ANY COCKPIT CREW MEMBER INTERVENTION; UNLESS THE UNRULY PAX BECAME A DIRECT THREAT TO THE SAFETY OF THE ACFT; PAX; OR CREW. WE INFORMED RAMP CTL OF OUR SIT AND THEY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF MAKING CERTAIN WE WOULD HAVE AN OPEN GATE ON OUR ARR AND MAKING THE REQUISITE COMPANY NOTIFICATIONS. DEPLANING PAX INFORMED ME THAT THIS PAX DID NOT PUNCH HIS SISTER; BUT THAT THE BLOW FLT ATTENDANT #2 HAD OBSERVED HIT AND DENTED THE INSIDE PANE OF THE WINDOW IMMEDIATELY BEHIND SEAT YF. (THIS WINDOW WAS IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF HIS SISTER'S FACE.) THIS ITEM WAS PLACED AS A NUMBERED WRITE-UP IN THE LOGBOOK. CHICAGO POLICE MET US ON ARR; AND BASED ON THEIR ASSESSMENT; TRANSPORTED THIS PAX TO; AND PLACED HIM IN THE CUSTODY OF A MENTAL HOSPITAL IN CHICAGO; RATHER THAN PLACING THIS INDIVIDUAL UNDER ARREST. THROUGHOUT THIS INCIDENT; BOTH FLT ATTENDANTS WERE SO CALM AND PROFESSIONAL; YOU COULD HAVE MADE A LIVE SCHOOLHOUSE TRAINING VIDEO. THEY DID A SUPERB JOB OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE COCKPIT AND GOING THE EXTRA MILE IN SHOWING CONCERN AND COMPASSION TOWARDS ALL THE PAX; EVEN OUR UNRULY GUEST. ANOTHER SISTER MET PAX AND THE SISTER THAT FLEW WITH HIM AT THE GATE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING; BASED ON A CONVERSATION THAT PAX HAD WITH OUR CUSTOMER SVC MGR; THAT PAX X SUFFERS FROM SOME TYPE OF MENTAL DISORDER; BUT HAD NOT BEEN SEEING HIS DOCTOR OR TAKING HIS MEDICATION. PAX Y FURTHER SPECULATED THAT THE DRINKING AND VALIUM USE WERE BECAUSE PAX X GREATLY FEARS FLYING. MY OBSERVATION WAS THAT HIS BEHAVIOR PRESENTED A CLR AND PRESENT DANGER TO NOT ONLY HIMSELF; BUTALSO THOSE SEATED AROUND HIM. BASED ON HIS RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS AND A VIOLENT TEMPER; AS EVIDENCED BY HIS SHOUTING; SCREAMING; EXTREME PROFANITY; AND THROWING OF PUNCHES; IT IS NOT A STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION TO SEE HIM HURTING SOMEONE ELSE OR PUTTING THE SAFETY OF THE FLT IN JEOPARDY. THEREFORE; I HAVE 2 RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) OUR AIRLINES HAVE THE FAA PURSUE THIS INDIVIDUAL AND FINE HIM $1000 FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CREW MEMBER INSTRUCTIONS. EVEN IF HE IS TRULY DISTURBED; HE HAS NO BUSINESS FLYING NOR SHOULD HIS FAMILY ALLOW HIM TO FLY IN AN UNSTABLE; UNMEDICATED CONDITION. 2) ADDITIONALLY; PAX X SHOULD BE BANNED FROM FLYING UNLESS EVIDENCE CAN BE PRODUCED THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF HIS BEHAVIOR. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE FO; WHO FLEW A ROCK SOLID AIRPLANE TO A FLAWLESS LNDG. HE WAS THE PF AND NEVER TRIED TO WEAR ANY OTHER HAT. THE CUSTOMER SVC MGR WHO MET US AND DEALT WITH PAX X'S SISTERS WAS AWESOME. NOT ONLY WAS SHE THE CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL; I COULD FEEL THE COMPASSION AND CONCERN SHE HAD FOR PAX X AND HIS FAMILY.

THERE WAS NO NEED; ON THAT DAY; TO GIVE OUT XHJ; AS THE COACH CABIN HAD LOTS OF EMPTY SEATS. THESE SEATS SHOULD NEVER BE SOLD. FLT ATTENDANTS ALSO HAVE RIGHTS. PAX EXPECT US TO SHUT OFF THE LIGHT; BE QUIET; ETC. I CANNOT SIT IN A DARK GALLEY ON AN INSERT (BIN). IT IS INHUMANE. I ALWAYS FLY EITHER #4 OR #5; SO I ALSO ENCOUNTER PROBS WHEN THOSE SEATS ARE OCCUPIED. THIS; IN MY MIND; IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT SHE WAS WORKING IN THE FIRST CLASS GALLEY AND HEARD LOUD VOICES; WHEN A CALL CAME FROM ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT TO THE PURSER TO IMMEDIATELY COME TO BUSINESS CLASS FOR A PAX ASSAULT OF A FLT ATTENDANT. ACCORDING TO THE PURSER; THE INCIDENT STARTED ON THE GND. A FIRST CLASS PAX; WHO WAS A BIG; BURLY MAN; TOOK HIS WIFE SOME CHAMPAGNE BACK TO COACH; WHERE SHE WAS SITTING. SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN BOOKED IN THE CREW REST SEATS; WHICH ARE ACROSS FROM THE BUSINESS CLASS GALLEY. THE COMPANY IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BOOK THESE SEATS IF THE FLT IS OVER 8 HRS; AND SHOULD NOT BOOK THEM WHEN THE PLANE IS NOT FULL; BECAUSE THE BUSINESS CLASS FLT ATTENDANTS USE THEM AS A VITAL EXTENSION OF THEIR SMALL GALLEY. AT THIS POINT; IT IS UNCLR IF THE ASSAULTED FLT ATTENDANT CHASTISED HIM FOR BRINGING HIS WIFE SOME CHAMPAGNE; BUT THE WIFE TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT THE FLT ATTENDANTS WERE NASTY TO HER. LATER IN THE FLT; WORDS WERE SAID AND THE MAN HAD PINNED THE FLT ATTENDANT'S ARM AGAINST THE FUSELAGE WALL; INJURING HER. SHE WAS HEARD SCREAMING AND CRYING. THE PLTS WERE TOLD OF THE INCIDENT; BUT DID NOT LEAVE THE COCKPIT. THE INJURED FLT ATTENDANT DIDN'T GO TO THE LAYOVER HOTEL; BECAUSE HER ARM WAS INJURED AND SHE WAS TRAUMATIZED; SO SHE WANTED TO DEADHEAD HOME IMMEDIATELY. SHE IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF SUING THE MAN.

AS HE AROSE; HE BUMPED HIS HEAD ON THE FUSELAGE. I ASKED MR X TO PLEASE TAKE HIS SEAT AND HE DID SO; APOLOGIZING. BEING FLT ATTENDANT #6; MY JUMP SEAT WAS AT 3R. PAX X CONTINUED SPEAKING VIRTUALLY WITHOUT PAUSE TO THE NOW SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE PAX AT XH AND THEN TO ME. MR X APPEARED OVERLY FRIENDLY; ALMOST AS IF INTOXICATED; HOWEVER HIS SPEECH AND COHERENCE APPEARED NORMAL; SO I DISCOUNTED IT AS SIMPLY EXCITEMENT. I ALSO FELT HE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT MENTALLY HANDICAPPED; AS I DID NOT SMELL ALCOHOL ON HIS PERSON. WHILE SEATED IN MY JUMP SEAT; AND AFTER MUCH CONVERSATION; I LEARNED HE WORKED AT OUR CREW HOTEL AND THAT HE WAS A NERVOUS FLIER. I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE; TO RELAX AND GET SOME SLEEP. I WORKED PRIMARILY IN FIRST CLASS BUT LEARNED THAT PAX X HAD BEEN CAUSING NUMEROUS PROBS INFLT. FROM THE DESTRUCTION HE APPARENTLY CAUSED IN THE 3R LAVATORY; IT BECAME CLR THAT HE NEEDED TO BE WATCHED AND THE COCKPIT WAS INFORMED. WHEN I WENT BACK TO COACH TO SEE IF I COULD HELP; I NOTICED THE MAN THAT HAD BEEN SEATED NEXT TO HIM HAD RE-SEATED ELSEWHERE; AND THAT THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF MR X (THE EXIT AREA) HAD BEEN LITTERED AS IF A SMALL CHILD HAD GONE OUT OF CTL. PAX X BEGAN SPITTING; RINGING HIS FLT ATTENDANT CALL BUTTON INCESSANTLY; AND EJECTING STRONG VERBAL ABUSE UPON FLT ATTENDANTS AND ESPECIALLY PAX. IT TRULY SEEMED AS IF WE HAD A LOOSE MONKEY ONBOARD THE ACFT. UPON DSCNT; I RETURNED TO MY JUMP SEAT; CLEANED IT AND SAT DOWN. MR X WAS MUMBLING HALF TO ME; HALF TO HIMSELF; AND HALF INCOHERENTLY. HE BEGAN TO BERATE OUR AIRLINE; AND WHEN I IGNORED HIM BY AVOIDING EYE CONTACT AND CONVERSATION; HE BEGAN TO BERATE ME; AMONG OTHER THINGS; BY ASKING IF I WAS STUPID AND CALLING ME BY NAME. HE UNFASTENED HIS SEAT BELT AND I TOLD HIM TO FASTEN IT; WHICH HE DID. ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER; AS WE TAXIED IN; MR X AGAIN UNFASTENED HIS SEAT BELT; STOOD; AND BEGAN TO PULL HIS ITEMS FROM THE OVERHEAD BIN; AS I CONTINUED TO ASK HIM TO TAKE HIS SEAT. MR X REFUSED TO TAKE HIS SEAT SAYING SOMETHING IN A MOCKING FASHION. AS I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY EXIT; FLT ATTENDANT #4; WHO HAD ALSO BEEN TRYING TO KEEP OUR COCKPIT-STORMER IN HER SEAT; WAS ABLE TO GET MR X SEATED. I THEN STOWED HIS BELONGINGS. AS MR X SAT; HE ATTEMPTED TO GET UP WHILE HIS SEAT BELT WAS FASTENED; FINALLY LOOSENING IT ENOUGH TO WHERE HE WAS SITTING ON THE CTR ARMREST. HE THEN REPEATEDLY REQUESTED THAT I GET HIS BAGS. AFTER THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN WAS TURNED OFF; MR X ROSE QUICKLY AND ATTEMPTED TO SHOVE PAX OUT OF HIS WAY; TELLING THEM TO MOVE. I SLIPPED IN FRONT OF HIM TO KEEP HIM FROM KNOCKING PAX DOWN AND HE FOLLOWED ME UP THE AISLE BERATING ME AND CALLING ME NAMES. THE FACT THAT I IGNORED HIM SEEMED TO MAKE HIM MORE VERBALLY ABUSIVE. AT THE BOARDING DOOR; I PRESENTED HIM TO THE POLICE. MANY OF US FEEL STRONGLY THAT FEDERAL AUTHS SHOULD HAVE MET THE ACFT UPON LNDG; AS WE FELT WE HAD ALL THE CRITERIA FOR PROSECUTABLE FEDERAL OFFENSES. ALTHOUGH I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LCL POLICE; I WAS MIFFED THAT A PAX WAS ABLE TO LITERALLY HOLD US HOSTAGE WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE NO REPERCUSSIONS. AT MINIMUM; I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT MR X IS NEVER TO AGAIN BE ALLOWED CARRIAGE ON OUR AIRLINES. I ALSO CONSIDER MR X TO BE A DIRECT THREAT TO OUR FLCS WHO LAYOVER AT THE HOTEL AT WHICH HE WORKS. HIS MENACING AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARD CREW MEMBERS MAY ONLY BE EXACERBATED BY HIS RECENT EXPERIENCE; AND I FEEL HE LACKS THE MENTAL STABILITY TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE ROOM KEYS AND VEHICLE KEYS OF OUR CREW MEMBERS OR ANY HOTEL GUESTS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THAT THE MAN WAS OUT OF CTL; LIKE A WILD ANIMAL HAD BEEN LET LOOSE IN THE CABIN. HE BELIEVES THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TIED HIM DOWN TO HIS SEAT. THE COCKPIT OFFERED NO SUPPORT TO THE CREW; AND THE CAPT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WRITING A RPT ON THE INCIDENT.

THE POLICE SAID IT WAS NOT IN THEIR JURISDICTION; BECAUSE IT HAPPENED OVER INTL WATERS. THE RPTR THOUGHT THAT THE POLICE COULD HAVE SHOWN MORE INTEREST IN THE CASE AND NOTIFIED THE FBI. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 487066: UPON BOARDING; PRIOR TO PUSHBACK; A PAX WAS OBSERVED DRINKING ALCOHOL FROM A FLASK. ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT ADVISED PAX (MR X) HE COULD NOT DRINK FROM HIS OWN FLASK. THE FLASK WAS GIVEN TO A FLT ATTENDANT. A SECOND FLASK WAS TAKEN AWAY WITH THE COMMENT; 'GO AHEAD; THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.' MR X WAS LOUD; YELLING AT ANOTHER PAX TO 'COVER UP.'

AT ONE POINT; PAX WAS SITTING ON SLIDE CONTAINER (3R) CRYING. THE PAX THREW A MEAL TRAY ON THE FLOOR AND BECAME VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO ALL FLT ATTENDANTS. HE CALLED FLT ATTENDANT #1 AN 'UGLY *%$^ #$@!*;' CHALLENGING HER TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR; SAYING HE 'KNEW SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.' HIS BEHAVIOR WAS ALWAYS ERRATIC AND UNSETTLING.

MR X; A MAN IN HIS FORTIES; WHO IS APPROX 6 FT 2 INCHES AND 280 LBS; SAID; WITH A CLENCHED FIST AND 1 FINGER EXTENDED; TO MR Y; AN OLDER MAN OF ABOUT 65-70 YRS OLD; 'IF YOU PUSH MY SEAT AGAIN I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO PUSH ABOUT.' FLT ATTENDANT #4 INTERVENED AND ASKED IF MR X COULD RAISE HIS SEAT A LITTLE BIT; BECAUSE IT WAS CLRLY EXTENDED BEYOND ITS USUAL PITCH. MR X REFUSED AND SAID TO 'CALL A MECH.' BECAUSE WE WERE FULL; MR Y TRADED SEATS WITH HIS WIFE; WHO WAS SHORTER; IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY FURTHER CONFRONTATION BTWN HIMSELF AND MR X. AT THIS TIME; I LEFT FLT ATTENDANT #3; THE FIRST CLASS GALLEY FLT ATTENDANT TO FINISH THE FIRST CLASS SVC. I PROCEEDED TO THE BACK TO ASCERTAIN WHAT EXACTLY HAD TAKEN PLACE. COACH WAS NOT QUITE FINISHED PICKING UP THE MEAL TRAYS. I WAITED UNTIL THEY WERE FINISHED AND FLT ATTENDANT #4 INFORMED ME THAT MR X WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ME. AS I WAS FINDING OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED FROM THE COACH FLT ATTENDANTS; MR X CAME TO THE BACK TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT. IN A VERY LOUD AND BOORISH MANNER; MR X; WHO APPEARED TO BE DRUNK; CALLED MR Y; 'A *&^%#$@&;' AND A 'JERK.' I ASKED MR X NOT TO USE THAT KIND OF OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE; BUT HIS VOCABULARY REPEATEDLY CONSISTED OF IT. I; HOWEVER; LISTENED TO HIS SIDE OF THE STORY AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE UNCOMFORTABLE SURROUNDINGS. HE THEN DEMANDED MY NAME AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER FLT ATTENDANT INVOLVED. I TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE MY BUSINESS CARD AND REF THIS FLT NUMBER WITH ANY FUTURE COMPLAINTS. AFTER TAKING NOTE OF MR X'S COMPLAINT; I ASKED HIM TO TAKE HIS SEAT; BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HIS INTIMIDATING BODY LANGUAGE. WHENEVER HE SPOKE; HE WOULD LEAN IN MY FACE AND TOUCH ME ON THE BACK; SHOULDER AND HIPS. HE AGREED TO GO BACK TO HIS SEAT; BUT WANTED 2 MORE CHARDONNAYS. I TOLD HIM WE COULD NOT SERVE HIM ANY MORE ALCOHOL AT THIS TIME. HE APPEARED TO BE DRUNK AND SMELLED OF LIQUOR. I ALSO TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT CONFRONT PAX IN A THREATENING MANNER OR WE WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE TO LAND AT THE NEAREST LOCATION AND HAVE HIM REMOVED; OR HAVE THE LCL AUTHS MEET HIM IN LONDON. REFUSING TO TAKE THE SIT SERIOUSLY; HE LAUGHED AND SAID; 'I'D LOVE TO LAND IN SHANNON; I'D LOVE TO GO TO JAIL; I'D LOVE TO BE ON THE NEWS;' AND 'I'D LOVE TO SUE YOUR AIRLINE.' HE ALSO SAID HE FREQUENTLY WRITES OUR AIRLINE COMPLAINT LETTERS TO OBTAIN FREE TRAVEL VOUCHERS. I AGAIN TOLD HIM I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BRING HIM MY BUSINESS CARD AND THAT HE WAS FREE TO WRITE TO OUR AIRLINE ABOUT THIS SIT. AT THIS TIME; MR X BECAME MORE AGREEABLE AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NO PROB AND RETURNED TO HIS SEAT AFTER BEING SERVED A COKE. HOWEVER; MR X WAS SITTING NEXT TO MR Z IN XF. UNFORTUNATELY; THE FLC WAS NOT AWARE OF ONE OF THESE TWO PAX HAD BROUGHT ON 3 LITERS OF GIN; WHICH THEY HID FROM US AND SUBSEQUENTLY CONSUMED DURING THE FLT. DURING THE FLT MR X KEPT RETURNING TO COACH GALLEY FOR COKES AND TO HASSLE THE FLT ATTENDANTS WITH WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE COMIC ANTICS; BUT THE CREW FOUND TO BE INTIMIDATING. I CAME BACK TO CHK ON THE SIT. MR X PLACED HIS ARMS AROUND ME TELLING ME THERE WAS NO PROB. I ASKED HIM NOT TO TOUCH ME; BUT HE KEPT ON HUGGING ME. I ALSO TOLD HIM HE BETTER NOT BE DRINKING ANY ALCOHOL. HE SAID HE WAS NOT; AND ONCE AGAIN RETURNED TO HIS SEAT WITH HIS COKE. APPROX 1 1/2 HRS BEFORE LNDG; MR X RETURNED TO THE GALLEY AND THIS TIME WANTED ALCOHOL. THE COACH FLT ATTENDANTS ONCE AGAIN CALLED ME; AS THEY BEGAN TO BECOME INCREASINGLY AFRAID AND FRUSTRATED BY THIS PAX AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM. I WENT TO THE BACK AND OVERHEARD THE FLT ATTENDANTS REFUSE TO SERVE HIM ALCOHOL. I HEARD MR X SAY: 'THERE WOULD BE&^%$ FOR YOU TO PAY IF I DON'T GET A DRINK OR AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY I CAN'T HAVE ONE.' I INTERJECTED AND TOLD MR X THREATENING REMARKS OF ANY KIND WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED HERE AND REMINDED HIM THAT HE AND I ALREADY HAD AGREED HE WOULDN'T BE DRINKING ANY MORE ON THIS FLT. HE SAID THAT WAS FINE AND WANTED TO WRITE ALL OF THIS DOWN ON HIS PIECE OF PAPER SO HE COULD SUE OUR AIRLINE. HE HARASSED AND DISRUPTED THE FLT ATTENDANTS IN THE BACK; BY INSISTING I COME TO SEE HOW FAR HIS SEAT BACK COULD GO. I ONCE AGAIN WENT BACK TO HIM. THIS TIME I INFORMED HIM THAT LCL AUTHS WOULD DEFINITELY BE MEETING HIM; ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM PAX SVC; UPON ARR; AND THAT WE COULD CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION AT THAT TIME; BECAUSE I HAD THINGS TO DO TO ENSURE OUR ACFT LANDED SAFELY. AS WE PREPARED FOR LNDG; FLT ATTENDANT #4 DISCOVERED THE 3 EMPTY LITERS OF GIN AND WAS TOLD BY THE PAX SITTING IN XC; MS X; THAT MR X AND MR Z HAD BEEN DRINKING FROM THEM THE ENTIRE FLT. FLT ATTENDANT #4 CONFISCATED THE BOTTLES AND TURNED THEM INTO THE LCL AUTHS ON ARR. PAX X ALSO CONTINUED TO RECLINE HIS SEAT BACK ON LNDG TO SHOW EVERYONE HOW FAR IT COULD GO BACK. HE ALSO COERCED MR Z INTO PUSHING HIS SEAT BACK. EVEN AFTER THE POLICE DETAINED AND CONSEQUENTLY ARRESTED BOTH MR Z AND MR X; MR X DID NOT TAKE THE SIT SERIOUSLY AND CONTINUED TO BELIEVE OUR AIRLINE WOULD BE COMPENSATING HIM IN THE LONG RUN. FLT ATTENDANT #3 AND FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND MYSELF PROVIDED THE POLICE WITH EYEWITNESS RPTS. THIS PROC DETAINED THE ENTIRE CREW FOR 2 HRS AFTER OUR ARR. THE CREW; HOWEVER; DID A WONDERFUL JOB HANDLING MR X; WORKING TOGETHER TO RESOLVE A TENSE SIT; AND COOPERATING GRACIOUSLY WITH THE LCL AUTHS. OUR CAPT; XX; ALSO PROVED TO BE A GREAT LEADER AND COORDINATOR WITH BOTH THE CREW AND GND STAFF TO ULTIMATELY OBTAIN OUR SAFE ARR IN LONDON. IN THE END; PAX X CLRLY DEMONSTRATED A RPT TO THE COMPANY; THREATENING AND INTIMIDATING PAX AND CREW MEMBERS; INTERFERING WITH CREW MEMBER'S DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES; AND DRINKING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES NOT SERVED BY A CREW MEMBER; WHICH CREATED AN ALCOHOL RELATED DISTURBANCE INFLT.

VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED ALL DAY LONG AND SINCE WE WERE OPERATING WITHIN APPROX A 6 MI RADIUS OF THE ARPT; NO FLT PLAN WAS FILED. IT WAS XA01; AND BEFORE TKOF CHKS WERE ACCOMPLISHED AND WE PROCEEDED TO TAKE OFF FROM RWY 12 AT OPN. AFTER TKOF AND TKOF CHKS WERE ACCOMPLISHED; I INITIATED CONTACT WITH ZTL AT XA04. I INFORMED THE CTLR WE HAD JUST DEPARTED THOMASTON AND WERE PRESENTLY AT 2500 FT MSL AND CLBING TO 14500 FT MSL WITH JUMPERS AT THOMASTON. AT XA05 THE CTLR CAME BACK AND GAVE US A XPONDER CODE OF XXXX. THE CLB TO ALT WAS UNEVENTFUL; HOWEVER; THE WINDS WERE SHIFTING ALL DAY LONG MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE THE JUMPERS A GOOD 'SPOT.' THE DEFINITION OF A 'GOOD SPOT' IS AN ADVANTAGEOUS EXIT POINT FROM THE ACFT TO LET THE JUMPERS DRIFT (DUE TO PREVAILING WINDS) DURING FREE-FALL; SO THAT THEY MAY OPEN THEIR PARACHUTES SLIGHTLY UPWIND AND LAND AT THE DESIGNATED LNDG ZONE. PIC COMMENTED THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE ALT AND JUMP RUN COINCIDE HE WOULD PERFORM A 360 DEG TURN WITH ABOUT 10-15 DEGS OF BANK. ONCE THE MANEUVER WAS COMPLETED; WE PROCEEDED ON COURSE FOR JUMP RUN PARALLEL WITH THE RWY DIRECTION OF 300 DEGS WITH AN OFFSET TO THE R OF APPROX .25-.30 NM. AS WE APCHED THE JUMP RUN; PIC TOLD ME; 'MAKE YOUR 2 MIN WARNING CALLS TO ZTL AND THOMASTON TFC.' THIS IS STANDARD OPERATING PROC. I XMITTED TO CTR '2 MINS BEFORE JUMPERS AWAY; ACFT X.' ZTL ACKNOWLEDGES THE XMISSION WITH 'ROGER; ACFT X.' THEN PIC GAVE THE COMMAND TO LOWER AND LEVEL THE TAILGATE OF THE AIRPLANE; I PERFORMED THE ACTION AND INFORMED PIC THE TAILGATE WAS LEVEL. THEN PIC COMMANDED FOR FLAPS AT 40 DEGS; AGAIN I PERFORMED THE ACTION AND INFORMED HIM THAT 'FLAPS TRACKING' AND THEN 'FLAPS SET; HYDS OFF.' PIC MUMBLED TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS JUMP RUN BECAUSE THE WINDS WERE UNPREDICTABLE. THIS WAS IDENTED BY A HIGHER THAN USUAL GND SPD FROM THE IFR GPS THAT IS ONBOARD THE ACFT. PIC THEN DECIDED; I ASSUME; TO MODIFY THE DIRECTION OF THE JUMP RUN. IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO CONSIDERING THE GND SPD WE ENCOUNTERED. WE NEVER AT ANY TIME TURNED A GREEN LIGHT ON IN THE ACFT. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT FACTOR; BECAUSE THE ACFT IS PLACARDED AT THE TAILGATE THAT THE GREEN LIGHT IS THE ONLY TIME JUMPERS MAY EXIT THE ACFT. AT WINGS LEVEL I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SAME CTLR FROM ZTL; ASKING US IF WE WERE STILL ON JUMP RUN; I NOTED THE URGENCY IN HER VOICE. PIC DIRECTED ME TO INFORM CTR THAT WE WERE STILL IN PROGRESS OF JUMP RUN. SHE QUICKLY INFORMED US WE HAD AN ACR JET AT OUR 1 O'CLOCK POS; AT THE SAME ALT AND CLOSING; HOWEVER; I DON'T RECALL ANY DISTANCE FROM THE JET BEING GIVEN. AT FIRST I COULD NOT SEE THE ACR JET; AND INFORMED THE CTLR THAT WE WERE NEGATIVE FOR FINDING THE ACR ACFT. I SCANNED INTENSELY FOR THE ACFT THEN I VISUALLY IDENTED THE PLANE; AND QUICKLY CALLED BACK TO CTR; 'I GOT IT; I GOT IT.' THE ACR JET APPEARED TO BE ON A 60 DEG INTERCEPT COURSE WITH US AND THE ACR JET WAS LESS THAN 2.0 MI AND CLOSING QUICKLY. SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING THIS EXCHANGE WITH CTR; I INFORMED PIC; THAT WE HAD TFC AT OUR 1 O'CLOCK POS; SAME ALT AND CLOSING QUICKLY. PIC COULD NOT SEE THE ACR JET; AND WHEN I VISUALLY IDENTED THE ACR JET AND CALLED CTR; PIC ASKED ME WHICH WAY TO TURN BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SEE THE PLANE. I SUSPECT PIC COULD NOT SEE THE PLANE BECAUSE THE METAL FRAMES THAT ENCASED OUR PLANE'S COCKPIT WINDOWS MAY HAVE BLOCKED HIS VIEW DUE TO THE ANGLE FROM THE L SEAT. WE NEEDED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO TURN AWAY FROM THE ONCOMING ACR JET. WHEN PIC ASKED ME WHICH WAY TO TURN IN ADDITION TO NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PLANE; I KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT JUDGE THE MANEUVER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE ACR JET. WITHOUT HESITATION I THEN BANKED THE AIRPLANE 25 DEGS R AND TURNED TO THE R 180 DEGS. PIC SAW THE ACR JET AS WE TURNED OUT OF THE WAY. DURING THIS TIME; THE RED LIGHT WAS ON INSIDE OUR AIRPLANE; THIS MEANS TO STANDBY. IT IS CLRLY PLACARDED IN THE PLANE WHAT THE 2 DIFFERENT LIGHTS INDICATE. WHEN I TURNED THE AIRPLANE; WE INFORMED CTR THAT WE HAD NOT RELEASED ANY JUMPERS FROM ACFT X. THE ACR CREW; UNDERSTANDABLY; REPLIED WITH GREAT CONCERN THAT JUMPERS; IN FACT; WERE EXITING FROM OUR ACFT. PIC AND I COULD NOT SEE FROM THE COCKPIT IF PEOPLE WERE INDEED EXITING THE TAILGATE BECAUSE THERE WERE 30 JUMPERS BLOCKING THE VIEW OF THE TAILGATE. I WITNESSED THE LAST GROUP WHICH WAS A TANDEM MASTER AND PAX WITH A CAMERAMAN; I YELLED AS LOUD AS I POSSIBLY COULD AT THEM TO NOT JUMP; THEY LOOKED AT ME AND DROPPED OFF THE TAILGATE INTO BLUE SKIES. BY THIS TIME THE ACR CREW ASKED THE CTLR FOR OUR TAIL NUMBER; SHE COMPLIED WITH THEM. ACFT X RADIOED TO THE ACR CREW AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE COURSE OF EVENTS. PIC AND I WERE BEYOND ASTONISHMENT IN WITNESSING THE SELFISH ACTS OF THE JUMPERS AND BLATANT DISREGARD TO THE PIC OF THE ACFT. I WANTED TO CLOSE THE TAILGATE DURING THE EPISODE BUT I KNEW THAT THE JUMPERS HAD POSITIONED THEMSELVES ON THE TAILGATE DURING RED STANDBY LIGHT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS TO ATTEMPT CLOSING THE DOOR WITH PEOPLE STANDING ON THE TAILGATE. SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED DUE TO DOOR CLOSING UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM. SINCE SO MANY JUMPERS WERE BLOCKING THE VIEW OF THE TAILGATE IT WASN'T WORTH RISKING MORE LIVES WHILE TRYING TO AVOID ANOTHER PLANE. THE LIGHT WENT FROM RED (STANDBY) TO THE OFF POS WHICH MEANS 'DO NOT JUMP.' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THIS IS AN OP THAT USES A LOAD ORGANIZER (JUMP MASTER) FOR CTL AND BRIEFING OF THE JUMPERS. THIS DAY THERE WERE BTWN 28 AND 32 JUMPERS ABOARD. POSTFLT BRIEFING WAS HELD TO DEBRIEF JUMPERS AND LOAD ORGANIZERS AS TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED. THE JUMP LIGHT SYS IS THE ONLY COM AVAILABLE BTWN THE COCKPIT AND THE JUMP MASTER OR JUMPERS.

I CAME OUT FROM ACFT ABOUT 10 MINS BEFORE DEP TIME AND NOTIFIED THE AGENT AND THE BOARDING FLT ATTENDANT THAT CARRY ON LUGGAGE WAS LIMITED TO 'UNDER SEAT' LUGGAGE. AS I INFORMED THE FLT ATTENDANT; A WOMAN CAME TO BOARD AND HAD HER 'ROLL-ABOARD' AND A COMPUTER BAG. THE BOARDING FLT ATTENDANT TOLD THE CUSTOMER THAT WE WOULD NEED TO CHK HER ROLL-ABOARD. THE WOMAN PROCEEDED TO WALK PAST HER AND CAME BY ME. I; TOO; TOLD THE WOMAN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO CHK HER ROLL-ABOARD. SHE STOPPED AND ASKED ME WHY. I TOLD HER IT WAS BECAUSE THE CABIN WAS FULL. WE WERE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE HER ROLL-ABOARD IN THE CABIN. SHE SAID TO ME 'PER FAA REG I AM ALLOWED 2 CARRY-ON ITEMS.' I SAID THAT I UNDERSTAND; BUT THAT OUR CABIN WAS FULL AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CHK THE BAG. SHE WENT ON TO TELL ME ABOUT; OUR AIRLINES LOSING HER LUGGAGE AND THAT SHE WAS CHANGED OVER TO OUR FLT FROM OUR AIRLINE AND THAT THEY HAD TOLD HER THAT WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER LOST LUGGAGE. I SAID THAT I WAS SORRY FOR HER MISFORTUNE AND THAT I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THIS ROLL-ABOARD WOULD GET ON THE AIRPLANE. SHE RELENTED AND I CHKED THE BAG. WHEN I CAME BACK ONBOARD THE ACFT; THE 'DIRECTING' FLT ATTENDANT TOLD ME THAT SOME WOMAN HAD COME DOWN THE JETBRIDGE AND AS SHE ENTERED THE ACFT SHE EXCLAIMED 'WHERE THE *UCK IS MY SEAT? THE BOARDING FLT ATTENDANT ASKED TO SEE HER BOARDING PASS AND TOLD HER WHERE THE SEAT WAS LOCATED. IT WAS THE SAME WOMAN WHO HAD INITIALLY REFUSED TO CHK HER BAG. NEITHER ONE OF US FELT THREATENED BY THIS EXCLAMATION; BUT WERE TAKEN ABACK. I ATTRIBUTED THE ANGER TO HER MISFORTUNE EARLIER IN THE DAY AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD TO CHK HER BAG. AFTER TKOF; I WAS CALLED BACK BY ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT THAT A CUSTOMER IN SEAT YA; MS Y; WISHED TO SPEAK WITH ME. SHE TOLD ME THAT EACH TIME SHE ATTEMPTED TO RECLINE HER SEAT BACK; THE WOMAN BEHIND HER WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO AND WOULD PUSH IT FORWARD AGAIN. WHEN I WENT BACK TO SPEAK WITH THE WOMAN IN XA; IT WAS THE SAME WOMAN WHO I HAD THE ENCOUNTER WITH EARLIER. I BELIEVE HER NAME IS MS X. WHEN I SPOKE WITH MS X SHE SAID THAT SHE 'COULDN'T GET ANY WORK DONE;' BECAUSE THE SEAT WAS RECLINING ONTO HER COMPUTER. WE WERE COMPLETELY FULL AND I WAS UNABLE TO MOVE EITHER CUSTOMER TO ANOTHER SEAT. I TOLD MS X THAT MS Y HAD PURCHASED THE SEAT AND WAS ALLOWED TO RECLINE AT HER DISCRETION. MS X SAID THAT I SHOULD INFORM MS Y THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP HER SEAT FORWARD. I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING MORE THAN INFORM MS X THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER SEATS AVAILABLE FOR EITHER OF THEM. I WAS SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. MS X WAS UNCOOPERATIVE AND DIDN'T LIKE MY RESPONSE. I LEFT AND INFORMED THE CAPT OF THE SIT. HE ASKED ME TO KEEP HIM INFORMED. ANOTHER 20 OR SO MINS LATER; I WAS CALLED BACK TO THE MAIN CABIN. MS Y WAS STILL UNABLE TO RECLINE HER SEAT. THE GENTLEMAN SEATED NEXT TO MS X OFFERED TO SWITCH SEATS; BUT MS X REFUSED; BECAUSE SHE WANTED THE WINDOW SEAT. I AGAIN TOLD MS X THAT HER BEHAVIOR WAS INAPPROPRIATE AND THAT I HAD INFORMED THE CAPT OF THE SIT. MS X ASKED WHO MY SUPVR WAS AND I TOLD HER THAT MY SUPVR WAS IN NEW YORK. I DID GIVE HER MY NAME WHEN SHE ASKED FOR IT. SHE THEN TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME AGAIN; BECAUSE I HAD MADE A 'HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT' FOR HER. SHE SAID SHE WISHED TO SPEAK TO THE CAPT. I TOLD HER I WOULD INFORM THE CAPT OF HER REQUEST BUT COULDN'T GUARANTEE IF HE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME AND SPEAK WITH HER. SHE THEN SAID THAT I PROBABLY HADN'T EVEN INFORMED THE CAPT AND THAT I WAS LYING. I THEN WENT BACK TO THE CAPT AND TOLD HIM WHAT SHE SAID AND ASKED IF HE WOULD SPEAK WITH HER. THE CAPT DID SPEAK WITH MS X LATER INFLT. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SAID TO HER THAT WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE AT THE TIME AND THAT MS Y WAS ABLE TO RECLINE HER SEAT. HE ALSO INFORMED HER THAT SHE WAS INTERFERING WITH THE CREW AND THAT SHE WOULD NEED TO STOP. UPON LNDG; WE ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE FROM GND STAFF. THE OPERATIONAL MGR WAS AVAILABLE FOR US AT THE DOOR UPON DEPLANING. WE TOLD HIM THE SIT AND HE ASKED EACH OF THE CUSTOMERS TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE FLT. I STAYED UNTIL BOTH HAD TOLD THEIR STORIES. I DID HEAR MS Y SAY THAT SHE ONLY WANTED AN APOLOGY FOR HER BEHAVIOR AND MS X SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T DESERVE ONE. MS Y SAID SHE FELT THREATENED DURING THE FLT AND WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE WHOLE SIT.",,,,"CABIN ATTENDANT RPT; B767-200; JFK-LAX.

THE RPTR IMMEDIATELY LEFT HIS TICKET TAKING POS; AND RAN AFTER THE COUPLE; TELLING THEM TO PUT THE DOG IN THE CARRIER FOR THE REST OF THE FLT. THE RPTR SAID THAT WHEN THE PURSER WAS TALKING TO THE WIFE; WHO WAS SITTING ACROSS THE AISLE FROM THE HUSBAND; THE MAN WALKED OUT OF THE LAVATORY AND VIOLENTLY GRABBED THE PURSER'S ARM; TWISTING HER AROUND; AND SAID 'I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.' THE PURSER SUSTAINED BRUISES ON HER ARM FROM THE ENCOUNTER. THE PURSER HAD THE CAPT CALL FOR POLICE TO MEET THE FLT.

HE CAME UP TO THE FRONT JUMP SEAT WHERE I WAS SITTING; WHILE READING THE GATE INFO. HE SEEMED VERY AGITATED; STOOD OVER ME AND SAID THAT 'THEY' IN LAX HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS CONNECTION BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS DELAYED OUT OF DFW (WE WERE ABOUT 1 HR LATE). I TOLD HIM THAT ACCORDING TO MY INFO EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING ON SCHEDULE. HE SAID HE HAD REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN DFW AND 'WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.' I ASKED HIM HIS NAME; BUT HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME. INSTEAD; HE SAID 'SOMEONE IS GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY' AND ASKED ME FOR MY NAME. I GAVE HIM MY NAME AND REITERATED THAT ACCORDING TO THE LATEST INFO; ALL FLTS WERE LEAVING ON TIME; BUT THAT I WAS SURE PEOPLE WOULD ASSIST HIM IN DFW. HE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT AT WHICH TIME WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE HIS NAME FROM THE PAX MANIFEST. WE COMPLETED OUR DUTIES TO PREPARE FOR LNDG. UPON LNDG AND GATE ARR; HE JUMPED OUT OF HIS SEAT WHEN THE SEAT BELT SIGN WENT OFF. I DID NOT SEE HIM PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH FIRST CLASS; BUT ACCORDING TO FLT ATTENDANT #2 HE CAUSED AN ELDERLY WOMAN TO FALL BACK INTO HER SEAT AND STEPPED ON FLT ATTENDANT #3'S FOOT. (FLT ATTENDANT #3 HAD TO GO TO MEDICAL TO BE TREATED FOR HER INJURED FOOT.) PAX X ENDED UP FROM ROW X IN COACH TO BEING THE SECOND PERSON IN LINE WAITING FOR THE ACFT DOOR TO OPEN.

AFTER A BRIEF PUSHBACK AND AFTER BOTH ENGS WERE STARTED AND CHKLISTS COMPLETED; I CALLED TPA GND FOR TAXI INSTRUCTIONS. AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE; A GND CTLR ASKED US TO 'CONFIRM YOUR SQUAWK CODE.' I REPLIED WITH THE APPROPRIATE CODE. AT THIS POINT; ANOTHER PERSON CAME ON AND SAID 'ACR X; I DIDN'T ASK YOU FOR YOUR SQUAWK CODE; I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE READY TO TAXI' IN AN ANGRY MANNER. I IMMEDIATELY SAID YES. AT THIS POINT; SEVERAL XMISSIONS WERE BLOCKED AND ANOTHER COMPANY MD88 WAS CLRED TO TAXI THAT HAD PUSHED BACK RIGHT BESIDE US. WE WERE FINALLY GIVEN CLRNC TO FOLLOW COMPANY TO RWY 18R. AS WE TAXIED; A FEW ACFT PASSED US ON TXWY AND WE WERE TOLD OUR SEQUENCE WAS TO FOLLOW A NAVY F18 HORNET. WE WERE GETTING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF JETBLAST FROM THE F18 ENGS; SO THE CAPT ADDED SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THE F18 -- NO MORE THAN STANDARD IN THIS SIT. AT THIS POINT; THE GND CTLR SAID TAXI. RIGHT AS THIS XMISSION OCCURRED; OUR ONBOARD LEADER (LEAD FLT ATTENDANT) CAME UP TO THE COCKPIT AND STATED THAT A WOMAN HAD LEFT HER SEAT AND GONE TO THE BATHROOM; STATING IT WAS AN EMER. HOWEVER; SHE DID NOT ASK FOR ANY ASSISTANCE AND SAID SHE WOULD BE DONE QUICKLY. AT THIS POINT; GND ASKED IF WE WERE GOING TO TAXI. I REPLIED THAT WE HAD A PAX UP IN THE BACK OF THE ACFT AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO HOLD OUR POS FOR A FEW MOMENTS. GND CAME ON AND SAID ROGER. I FOUND THIS STRANGE SINCE 'WE' HAD ASKED FOR THE SHORT PAUSE. A FEW SECONDS LATER; GND CAME ON AGAIN AND ASKED IF WE WERE GOING TO TAXI. AT THIS POINT; THE CAPT STATED THAT WE HAD A PAX UP IN THE CABIN AND THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FOR A FEW MOMENTS; TO WHICH GND REPLIED; 'YOU WILL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT; TAXI DOWN AND HOLD SHORT OF THE RWY AND CONTACT TWR.' AT THIS POINT; THE LEAD FLT ATTENDANT CAME UP AND TOLD US THAT THE CABIN WAS SECURE. WE CALLED GND AND ASKED FOR CLRNC TO CONTINUE. AT THIS POINT HE SAID 'WRITE THIS NUMBER DOWN AND CALL WHEN YOU LAND.' THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE TAXI FROM BLOCK-OUT TO GEAR UP WAS 23 MINS. THE INCIDENT WITH THE PAX COULD NOT HAVE LASTED MORE THAN 2 MINS AND THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE TALKING TO GND SEVERAL ACFT ARRIVED AND DEPARTED RWY 18R. ALSO; THE F18 CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROB; IN THAT THE JETBLAST WAS ABNORMALLY HIGH REQUIRING A LONGER TAXI SPACE. THIS SPACE WAS MISINTERPRET BY GND AS FAILURE TO TAXI. AFTER GETTING TO JFK; THE CAPT CALLED THE NUMBER GIVEN AND THEY SAID THAT WE HAD CAUSED THE DELAY TO 5 ACFT. THIS SIMPLY WAS NOT TRUE. THE TIME BTWN US AND THE LAST ACFT (THE F18) WAS NOT MORE THAN 2 MINS. A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME CONSIDERING THE SAFETY OF THE PAX WAS AT STAKE. ALSO; AFTER TWR CLRED US FOR TKOF; HE ALSO CLRED ANOTHER ACFT FOR TKOF AS SOON AS WE HAD TAXIED ONTO RWY 18R. I HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES TO WHAT TRANSPIRED AND AGREED THE GND CTLR HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THE WRONG ACFT WHEN WE CALLED FOR THE SHORT PAUSE. A FEW CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THE FACT THAT THE RAMP AREA BECAME VERY CONGESTED AT PUSHBACK TIME. POSSIBLY A RAMP CTLR WOULD HELP EXPEDITED PUSHBACK AND TAXI TIMES. I ALSO BELIEVE THERE WAS TRAINING GOING ON IN THE GND FACILITY AND SOME MISCOM BTWN GND CTLRS AS TO WHICH ACFT REQUESTED THE PAUSE.",,,,"B737 FLC ACCUSED OF TAXI DELAY EVEN THOUGH GND CTLR ADVISED OF A CABIN SIT.",

CONTINUED TO TALK TO THE YOUNG MAN AND HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS AN ACR INTERN AND THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET FIRED. AS HE CONTINUED TO CALM DOWN; C3 ASKED HIM A SECOND TIME IF HE HAD ANY IDENT AND HE GAVE HER A TEMPORARY ACR IDENT WITH AN ALTERED DATE. AT THIS POINT; HE SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT HE WAS IN TROUBLE WITH NO WAY OUT AND ASKED C3 IF HE COULD EXPLAIN WHAT HE HAD DONE AND WHY. HIS STORY IS THAT HE HAD WORKED FOR RAMP SVCS APPROX 1 MONTH THIS SUMMER AS A COLLEGE PROJECT AND HAD BEEN GIVEN PASSES AND A TEMPORARY IDENT CARD. HE SAID HE WAS TRAVELING WITH A REVENUE PAX TO A WEDDING IN LAS AND WHEN HE REALIZED HE MIGHT NOT GET ON IN STL AS A NON REVENUE; HE WALKED PAST THE BOARDING AGENT WHILE SHE WAS BUSY.

I WAS FLT ATTENDANT #1 WORKING FIRST CLASS. I DID NOT HEAR OF ANY PAX MISCONDUCT UNTIL THE END OF THE FLT DURING OUR APCH. LATER; THOUGH; I DID FIND OUT THAT THE PAX WAS NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS AND WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS PAX AND THE FLC. I DO NOT HAVE THE PAX'S NAME BECAUSE I WAS NOT THE FLT ATTENDANT MOST INVOLVED; THEREFORE; DID NOT FILE A DETAILED RPT; BUT I WAS A STRONG WITNESS TO THE PAX'S BEHAVIOR. THE PAX WAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FEMALE WITH BLOND HAIR; APPROX 5 FT 11 INCHES; THIN FRAME WITH 3 PIERCINGS UNDER HER LOWER R LIP; APPROX 20-25 YRS OLD. THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT TOLD HER TO PLACE HER CARRY-ON BAG UNDER THE SEAT IN FRONT OF HER DURING APCH. WHILE HE ASKED HER TO DO THIS TASK; HE ALSO PLACED HIS HAND GENTLY ON HER SHOULDER; LEANING TOWARDS HER. SHE YELLED AND SCREAMED THAT SHE WAS SEXUALLY AND PHYSICALLY HARASSED BY THE FLT ATTENDANT TOUCHING HER SHOULDER. AT THIS POINT I WAS INFORMED OF THE PAX AND SO WAS THE COCKPIT CREW BECAUSE THE PAX WAS GETTING VERY VERBAL. WHEN THE FLT LANDED; SHE BEGAN TO RING HER FLT ATTENDANT CALL LIGHT BUTTON. WHEN ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT WENT OVER; THE PAX DEMANDED THE FLT ATTENDANT #4 EMPLOYEE NUMBER AND DECLARED SHE WOULD HAVE HIS JOB. THE PAX WAS TREATED VERY WELL DURING HER WILD TEMPERAMENT AND WAS TOLD BY ME TO SEE THE AGENT FOR ANY COMPLAINTS SHE HAD. WHEN ALL PAX DEPLANED; THE 3 FLT ATTENDANTS; INCLUDING ME; WITNESSED THE PAX SCREAMING AT THE AGENT. SHE SAW THE FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE DON'T WANT A 'HOMO' TOUCHING HER; ETC; ETC. SHE CURSED AT HIM AND MADE PLENTY OF DEROGATORY REMARKS ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY. WHEN HE IGNORED HER AND BEGAN TO WALK AWAY; SHE RAN AFTER HIM AND I INTERPED HER ACTIONS AS IF SHE WANTED TO PHYSICALLY ASSAULT HIM. AT THAT POINT A LOT OF YELLING AND SCREAMING TOOK PLACE BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO PHYSICALLY CONFRONT HIM. SHE WAS TRYING TO INITIATE A SERIOUS ARGUMENT. I; AS WELL AS THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT; BEGAN TO TELL HER TO CALM DOWN AND LEAVE THE PREMISES. THIS WENT ON FOR A FEW MINS UNTIL I AND THE OTHER CREW MEMBERS TRIED TO GET AWAY. THE INCIDENT FINALLY THEN CAME TO AN END. A FEW DAYS ALTER; ACR SENT ME THIS FORM TO RPT THIS INCIDENT. I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC FUTURE IDEAS ON HOW TO PREVENT INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE; BUT ONLY TO SAY THAT FLYING IS A PRIVILEGE. A PRIVILEGE; THAT IF ABUSED SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY. IF A PAX'S BEHAVIOR BECOMES IN ANY WAY; SHAPE OR FORM PHYSICAL; THEN THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO FLY.

I ADVISED FLT ATTENDANTS #3 AND #4 BEFORE SVC AND SHOWED THEM WHERE THE WOMAN WAS SEATED. DURING DRINK/FOOD SVC; FLT ATTENDANT #3 TOLD ME THE WOMAN ASKED FOR A DOUBLE RUM/DIET COKE. FLT ATTENDANT #3 TOLD THE WOMAN THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE ONLY 1 DRINK AT A TIME. MS X WAS OK WITH THAT. I TOLD BOTH FLT ATTENDANTS #3 AND #4 NOT TO SERVE ANY MORE DRINKS TO MS X. MS X STATED SHE 'NEEDED' A 'DOUBLE.' THAT'S WHEN I KNEW SHE MIGHT HAVE A DRINKING PROB. THEREFORE; NO MORE DRINKS WERE GIVEN TO MS X; EXCEPT FOR ANOTHER CAN OF DIET COKE. LATER INFLT; FLT ATTENDANT #3 ADVISED ME THAT A PAX ON BOARD WAS WAITING FOR BATHROOM WHEN MS X EXITED THE LAVATORY. HE SAW CIGARETTE SMOKE AND SMELLED IT COMING FROM MS X'S CLOTHES. FLT ATTENDANT #3 CAME AND TOLD ME. I ASKED HER IF SHE TALKED TO MS X ABOUT IT; SHE REPLIED 'NO.' I TOLD HER I WOULD TALK TO HER. I APCHED MS X AND ASKED HER IF SHE HAD BEEN SMOKING IN LAVATORY. I TOLD HER OF THE DANGER AND THAT I OR THE OTHER PAX DID NOT APPRECIATE HER COMPROMISING OUR SAFETY AND THAT SHE WOULD BE ARRESTED IN LAX IF SHE TRIED IT AGAIN. SHE REPLIED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD. LATER; FLT ATTENDANT #3 TOLD ME THAT MS X ASKED HOW I KNEW SHE WAS SMOKING IN LAVATORY. SHE TOLD HER A PAX TOLD US. MS X ASKED FLT ATTENDANT #3 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE WENT INTO THE LAVATORY AND SMOKED AGAIN. FLT ATTENDANT #3 TOLD HER SHE WOULD BE ARRESTED. MS X THEN ANNOUNCED SHE WAS A POLICE OFFICER AND FELT SHE WOULD NOT GET ARRESTED. I HAD ALREADY CALLED THE COCKPIT EARLIER AFTER THE SMOKING EVENT TO ASK WHY SMOKE DETECTOR DID NOT CHIME. THEY GAVE ME AN UNSATISFACTORY ANSWER. NOW; I CALLED THEM (COCKPIT) A SECOND TIME AND TOLD THEM WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO FLT ATTENDANT #3. I ASKED THEM TO CALL FOR SOMEONE TO MEET OUR ACFT; BECAUSE I WAS NOT TRUSTING MS X. ON APCH INTO LAX; WE WERE PICKING UP GLASSES/TRASH. MS X HAD A FULL GLASS OF LIQUID. I NOTICED HER SHAKING THE LAST DROP OF RUM INTO HER SODA. I INFORMED HER WE HAD TO PICK UP ALL GLASSES. SHE SAID 'NO; I'M KEEPING THIS; I PAID $4 FOR IT.' I SAID 'EXCUSE ME; WE SERVED YOU YOUR 1 DRINK 2 1/2 HRS AGO; YOU'RE NOT JUST DRINKING IT NOW. DID YOU BRING ON YOUR OWN ALCOHOL AND ARE YOU DRINKING THAT NOW?' SHE DIDN'T REPLY. I NEEDED TO CHK MY GALLEY FOR LNDG; SO FLT ATTENDANT #3 COLLECTED MS X'S GLASS. AFTER LNDG; THE PAX WERE ALL STANDING WAITING TO GET OFF AND A MALE PAX TOLD ME THAT DURING THE FLT MS X MUST HAVE DRANK 8 OR 9 MORE MINI LIQUOR DRINKS SHE HAD HAD IN HER PURSE. SHE WAS SNEAKING THEM. THAT'S WHY SHE SEEMED TO BE MORE INTOXICATED AT END OF FLT. I INFORMED PAX HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD US BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE ENDED UP IN A SERIOUS SIT. SPECIAL SVC AGENT MET ACFT. ME AND FLT ATTENDANT #3 GOT OFF PLANE AND MET SVC AGENT AND MS X AT GATE COUNTER. COME TO FIND OUT; A COUNSELOR FROM A REHABILITATION CTR WAS THERE TO ESCORT MS X TO CTR SO SHE COULD START 3-4 MONTHS TREATMENT FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. HE APOLOGIZED FOR HER BEHAVIOR. AGENT TOLD US SHE WOULD BE BANNED FROM FLYING ON AIRLINE AGAIN. MY COMMENTS: THE DFW AGENTS BOARDING THE FLT SHOULD BE QUESTIONED ON WHY THEY BOARDED MS X ON OUR FLT. I KNOW THEY SMELLED HER BREATH LIKE I DID. ALSO; WHY HAVE SMOKE DETECTORS IF THEY'RE NOT BUILT PROPERLY TO SOUND OFF AT ANY HINT OF SMOKE OR HEAT? THAT UPSETS ME VERY MUCH.

AFTER ALMOST ALL OF THE PAX WERE DEPLANED; FO AND I TOOK OUR BAGS AND LEFT THE ACFT AND NOTICED THE CUSTOMER SVC REPRESENTATIVE ON THE JET BRIDGE APCHING THE ACFT. FLT X LANDED IN LAX AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND THE PAX DEPARTED THE ACFT UNEVENTFULLY BEFORE THE CUSTOMER SVC REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED. 3 DAYS LATER ON JUL/TUE/01; AS I WAS SIGNING IN FOR THE SAME SEQUENCE; LAX CHIEF PLT MET ME IN OPS AND ASKED IF HE COULD SPEAK TO ME. I DISCUSSED THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED WHICH ARE EXPLAINED ABOVE. DURING OUR DISCUSSION CAPT INDICATED TO ME THAT FLT ATTENDANT HAD COME INTO HIS OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT FLT X. CAPT INDICATED TO ME THAT FLT ATTENDANT STATED THAT OUR PROB PAX HAD MADE A HIJACK THREAT. I TOLD CAPT THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF AHIJACK THREAT. AFTER MY MEETING WITH CAPT I PROCEEDED TO THE AIRPLANE AND BEGAN PREPARING THE COCKPIT FOR DEP. FLT ATTENDANT #1 WAS ONCE AGAIN THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT. FLT ATTENDANT CAME INTO THE COCKPIT AND BEGAN YELLING AT ME IN FRONT OF MY NEW FO AND WITHIN EARSHOT OF SEVERAL FLT ATTENDANTS STANDING NEAR THE COCKPIT; ABOUT THE FACT THAT ON OUR PREVIOUS FLT FO AND I DID NOT CALL A MALE 'MOD' AS REQUESTED. AFTER FLT ATTENDANT LEFT THE COCKPIT FO STATED TO ME 'I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR AND UNPROFESSIONAL.' DURING CRUISE; FLT ATTENDANT FELT COMPELLED TO PRIVATELY APOLOGIZE ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO FO FOR HER ACTIONS. THIS LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM AND OVERT INSUBORDINATION COMPROMISED MY AUTH AS CAPT AND ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH THE REST OF THE CREW. I AM EXTREMELY APPALLED THAT THE FLT ATTENDANTS COLLECTIVELY DECIDED THAT IT WAS INCONSEQUENTIAL TO TELL FO AND I THAT WE HAD A HIJACK THREAT. THE DECISION NOT TO TELL THE PLTS THAT A HIJACK THREAT WAS MADE RENDERED US UNABLE TO ASSESS THE SEVERITY OF THE SIT. IT IS ACR X'S POLICY TO CONSIDER ALL THREATS TO BE SERIOUS. THIS CLRLY PUT THE PAX AND CREW IN DANGER AND ALSO FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE. ALSO; FLT ATTENDANT #1'S DEMAND FOR A 'MALE CUSTOMER SVC REPRESENTATIVE' TO MEET THE ACFT; FLT ATTENDANT #1 CONTENDS SHE REQUESTED AN 'MOD;' WAS APPARENTLY HER INJUDICIOUS SOLUTION TO A HIJACK THREAT THAT WAS PRIVILEGED INFO OF ONLY THE FLT ATTENDANTS.

THE PURSER WANTED TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO JFK BECAUSE HE (THE MAN) WAS TRAVELING WITH HIS 10 YR OLD SON AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET THE SON TO NEW YORK; BUT THIS MAN WAS JUST SO UNBEARABLE.

HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAD TOO MUCH ALCOHOL. HIS LOUD VOICE WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO ANY FLT ATTENDANT HE ENCOUNTERED. WE DECIDED THAT NO MORE THAN 2 FLT ATTENDANTS SHOULD TRY AND DEAL WITH HIM AT ONE TIME TO AVOID HIS FEELING OF BEING OVERWHELMED. HE COMPLAINED OF BEING COLD OF BEING MISTRUSTED. HE WAS OFFERED HIS CHOICE OF SEATS; AS THERE WERE ONLY 10 PAX. HE WAS OFFERED ADDITIONAL BLANKETS. NOTHING WOULD HELP BUT TO GO TO FIRST CLASS. THE IRO CAME BACK TO SPEAK TO HIM AND HE WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO HIM AS WELL. FROM TIME TO TIME; I WOULD LEAVE AND LET ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT TAKE OVER.

HE HAD BEEN SERVED TWO GLASSES OF WINE AND WAS INSISTING UPON BEING SEATED IN FIRST CLASS; WHICH WAS EMPTY. THE FLT WS NEARLY EMPTY WITH ONLY 10 PAX IN BUSINESS CLASS AND THIRTY IN COACH.

THE FLT ATTENDANT BROUGHT THE NOTE TO THE COCKPIT AND THE FLT ATTENDANT TOLD ME THE LADY HAD GONE TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE TO SIT WITH HER PASTOR AND WAS QUITE UPSET; CRYING; DISTRAUGHT. SHE HAD SHOWN THE NOTE TO THE MAN SITTING NEXT TO HER. I DECLARED AN EMER WITH CTR AFTER CONTACTING THE DISPATCHER AND TELLING HIM OF MY DECISION TO DIVERT INTO ZZZ1. WE SQUAWKED 7700 AND LANDED AND HAD THE FLT ATTENDANTS EVACUATE THE PLANE VIA THE SLIDES. FLT ATTENDANTS DID A WONDERFUL JOB AND HAD ALL THE PAX ASSEMBLED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ACFT WITH ONLY ONE SPRAINED ANKLE AT THE TIME AND EVERYONE IN GOOD SPIRITS. MY FO DID A WONDERFUL JOB FLYING AND HELPING WITH DECISIONS. THE NOTE WAS TURNED OVER TO AIRPORT AUTHORITY POLICE OFFICER AND FBI AND FAA HAD THEIR QUESTION ANSWERED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 529141: AT APPROX XA25 THE CAPT RECEIVED A CALL FROM A FLT ATTENDANT REGARDING A MESSAGE THAT WAS JUST HANDED TO HER BY A PAX. THE CAPT HAD HER PASS THE MESSAGE UNDER THE COCKPIT DOOR. WE READ THE MESSAGE AND THE CAPT PROCEEDED TO CONTACT THE COMPANY. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN CTL OF THE ACFT (PLT FLYING); TO HANDLE THE RADIOS AND LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS FOR LNDG. WHILE FLYING THE ACFT I PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY THE CLOSEST SUITABLE AIRFIELD FOR LNDG. ZZZ2 WAS THE BEST CHOICE AND WAS APPROX 80 NM TO THE WSW. I INDICATED THIS TO THE CAPT AND HE AGREED. I THEN PREPARED THE COCKPIT FOR THE APCH INTO ZZZ2. THIS ALL TOOK APPROX FIVE MINS. THE CAPT FINISHED WITH THE COMPANY AND ANNOUNCED HE WAS BACK AND WE PROCEEDED TO PUT OUR PLAN TOGETHER. HE DECLARED AN EMER WITH CTR AND GOT US 'DIRECT' ZZZ2 WITH A DESCENT TO 11000 FT MSL. WE TURNED TOWARDS ZZZ2 AND HE MADE HIS FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PAX JUST LETTING THEM KNOW WE WERE NOT GOING ON TO ZZZ3; BUT RATHER DIVERTING TO ZZZ2 ARPT AND THAT HE WOULD GET BACK TO THEM IN A FEW MINS. THE CTLR ASKED FOR THE NATURE OF OUR EMER AND REQUESTED THE PERTINENT EMER INFO. THE CAPT TOLD CTLR ABOUT THE NOTE AND THAT WE WOULD BE LNDG ASAP AT ZZZ2 ARPT; HE ALSO INCLUDED THE STANDARD EMER INFO. WE DESCENDED AND WERE HANDED OFF TO APCH. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; WE WERE CLRED TO LAND. THE CAPT MADE ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PAX. THIS TIME HE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE NOTE; HE LET THEM KNOW THERE WAS A NOTE THREATENING THE ACFT AND THAT WE WOULD BE LNDG IMMEDIATELY. HE ALSO ASKED THEM TO LISTEN TO THE FLT ATTENDANTS AND TO FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS. AT THIS POINT THE CAPT TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT AND I HAD THE RADIOS AND THE CHKLISTS. ALL WENT AS NORMAL FROM THIS POINT FORWARD THROUGH ROLL OUT WHICH WAS APPROX XA45. I RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHERE TO PARK AFTER LNDG. ON ROLL OUT I ASKED ABOUT HOW WE WERE TO GET THE PAX OFF THE PLANE; WE DIDN'T SEE ANY AIR STAIRS NEAR THE EMER VEHICLES. I WAS TOLD TO GO TO THE DESIGNATED AREA AND THAT WE WOULD DISCUSS OUR OPTIONS THEN. OBVIOUSLY; I RESTATED OUR INTENT TO GET THE PAX OFF THE PLANE 'IMMEDIATELY' AND THEY STILL TOLD ME WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT IN A FEW MINS. THE CAPT THEN GOT ON THE RADIO (WE ARE JUST ABOUT STOPPED AS PER THEIR DIRECTIONS) AND HE TOLD THEM HE DIDN'T SEE ANY STAIRS. WE NEEDED TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF THE PLANE RIGHT NOW SO WERE GOING TO USE THE SLIDES. WE THEN RAN THE EVAC CHKLIST AND HE ANNOUNCED TO THE PAX THAT WE WERE GOING TO EVACUATE THE ACFT USING THE SLIDES AND TO PLEASE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS. HE SIGNALED THE EVACUATION; AND I WENT OUT THE L FORWARD EXIT AND DOWN THE SLIDE. THIS WAS APPROX XA50. BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE RAMP THERE WERE AT LEAST HALF OF THE PAX OFF THE PLANE. I SAW A PAX AT THE L OVER WING SLIDE STRUGGLING ON THE GND. I WENT TO HER IMMEDIATELY AND HELPER HER AWAY FROM THE PLANE; ASSISTED BY A POLICE OFFICER. SHE WAS COMPLAINING OF A TWISTED ANKLE ANDWAS VISIBLY IN SEVERE PAIN. A FIREMAN TOOK HER FROM OUR CARE AND I WENT BACK TO THE PLANE. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD I JUST INSTRUCTED THE PAX TO ASSEMBLE AT THE VEHICLES WITH THE FLASHING LIGHTS IN FRONT OF US AND TO KEEP EACH OTHER TOGETHER AWAY FROM THE PLANE. I GUESS THOSE SILLY HATS REALLY DO HAVE A PURPOSE BECAUSE EVERYONE LISTENED TO EVERY WORD I SAID AND FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY. THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY SENSE OF PANIC; IN FACT EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE VERY CALM AND ORDERLY. I TALKED TO THE EMER PEOPLE ON THE SCENE AND ASKED ABOUT THE 'NEXT' PART OF THE PLAN. I WAS TOLD TO KEEP EVERYONE IN PLACE AND TO WAIT FOR TRANSPORTATION. AT THIS TIME THE FLT ATTENDANTS WITH OUR GROUP WERE SPEAKING WITH THE PAX. THEY DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB; KEEPING THEM CALM AND REASSURED. THE LARGE PAX TRANSPORTER ARRIVED AND THE PAX BOARDED AND WERE TAKEN TO THE TERMINAL. AT ABOUT XB15 THE CAPT AND I GOT TOGETHER AND MET UP WITH THE ACR CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR; THE FBI REPRESENTATIVE; AND THE ARPT EMER CHIEF. EVERYTHING TO THIS POINT WAS WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER NORMAL AND UNEVENTFUL GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER; THERE WAS ONE EXCEPTION. THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF THE MESSAGE; XB00; DID NOT GET FORWARDED TO THE EMER CREWS AT THE ARPT AND THEY WERE NOT AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO DISCUSS OUR OPTIONS FOR DEPLANING THE PAX. THE INFO DID NOT GET PASSED ACCURATELY ENOUGH. EVEN WHEN I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO BE OFF THE PLANE IMMEDIATELY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY. WE WAITED FOR THE FBI TO CLR THE ACFT AND ALLOW US TO RETRIEVE THE CARRY ON BAGGAGE. WE SPOKE WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE DURING THIS TIME TO INCLUDE THE FBI; ACR; FAA SAFETY AND ARPT SECURITY. I HAVE THE SAME COMMENT REGARDING THE PASSAGE OF INFO. EVIDENTLY THE NATURE OF OUR EMER DID NOT REACH ALL LEVELS. WHILE WE WERE WAITING I NOTICED A TRUCK DRIVING TOWARD THE ACFT. IT WAS A MECHANIC WHO WAS TOLD TO RETRIEVE THE SLIDES SO THEY COULD GET A LADDER UP TO THE PLANE. NOBODY FROM THE FBI OR ARPT SECURITY HAD TOLD ANYONE TO GO NEAR THE PLANE. IT STILL HAD 30000 LBS OF FUEL ON BOARD AND THE THREAT HAD NOT BEEN CLRED. WE YELLED; HONKED AND FLASHED LIGHTS TO GET HIS ATTENTION AND HE RETURNED TO WHERE WE WERE. I TOLD HIM THE REASON WE WERE IN THIS SIT AND THAT UNLESS HE WAS TOLD SOMETHING DIFFERENT BY THE FBI; HE SHOULD STAY CLR OF THE ACR. HE WAS TOLD BY A SUPERIOR TO GET THE SLIDES; THAT'S IT. HE HAD NO IDEA OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER. ONCE THE ACFT WAS CLRED AND BACK IN THE CTL OF ACR WE WERE TOLD WE COULD RETRIEVE THE BAGGAGE ON BOARD. HOWEVER; THERE WAS ONE BAGGAGE HANDLER; A MECHANIC; THE ACR CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR; THE CAPT AND MYSELF ALL LEFT TO RETRIEVE THE BAGS FOR OVER 150 PEOPLE. IT TOOK QUITE A WHILE TO SAY THE LEAST. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THERE WEREN'T PERSONNEL SENT OUT TO DO THIS. FOR THE RECORD; EXTREME CARE WAS TAKEN IN REGARD TO THE CARRY ON BAGGAGE. WE TAGGED AS MANY AS WE COULD; AS TO LOCATION ON THE PLANE; AND CAREFULLY LOWERED THEM TO THE BAGGAGE CARTS VIA AN AIR SLIDE. ALL CONTENTS OF BAGS AND PURSES WERE SECURED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND TREATED AS OUR OWN. THE THREE ACR FOLKS (CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR; MECH AND BAGGAGE HANDLER) WERE OUTSTANDING. WE GOT THE BAGGAGE BACK TO THE TERMINAL AND EXPLAINED TO THE PAX HOW WE GATHERED THEIR BELONGINGS AND HOW WE PLANNED TO DISTRIBUTE THEM. THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THIS POINT. HOWEVER; DUE SECURITY REASONS I FORWARDED THEM TO THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN CURRENT OPS.",,,,"B757-200 PAX FOUND A BOMB THREAT NOTE IN THE TRAY TABLE; INFLT.",

AT THIS POINT; I FEARED THE PAX WOULD ATTEMPT TO TAKE CTL OF THE AIRPLANE; SO HAVING ALREADY RECEIVED CLRNC FROM GREER AND THIS BEING A NON TWRED ARPT; I FELT THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO CONTINUE THE APCH AND LAND. IN THE CONFUSION AND STRESS CAUSED BY MY SHOUTING; PANICKED PAX; I FORGOT TO CANCEL MY IFR CLRNC. LATER IN THE DAY AFTER REMEMBERING MY MISTAKE; I CONTACTED GREER APCH BY PHONE AND SPOKE WITH THE ON-DUTY SUPVR ABOUT MY LOSS OF RADIO COMS AND FAILURE TO CLOSE THE FLT PLAN. THE SUPVR STATED THAT HE COULD NOT FIND ANY NOTES OF PROBS OR ENTRIES IN THE LOGS FOR EARLIER IN THE DAY. I FEEL THAT CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE MY LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE; THE WX CREATING APPREHENSION IN THE PAX; AND THE FACT THAT THE OWNER WAS A STUDENT PLT WHO KNEW JUST ENOUGH TO CAUSE PROBS IN THE COCKPIT. ADHERING TO CHKLISTS AND PROCS ARE THE BEST ASSURANCE FOR NOT REPEATING THIS MISTAKE. ALSO; MAINTAINING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CTL AS PIC TO ENSURE NO PAX INTERFERENCE WITH THE SAFE OP OF THE ACFT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT SHE APOLOGIZED TO THE PAX UPON LNDG IN THAT SHE WAS SORRY THAT HE FELT THAT HER FLYING SCARED HIM AND WAS UNACCEPTABLE IN AN EFFORT TO DEFUSE THE PAX'S ATTITUDE. HOWEVER; SHE DID SEND A COPY OF THIS RPT TO THE PAX IN AN EFFORT TO INFORM HIM THAT HIS BEHAVIOR WAS NOT ONLY VERY DISTRACTING; BUT ALSO IN VIOLATION OF THE FARS.

I ASKED WHAT SHE WAS SAYING; SHE SAID THE WOMAN WAS SPEAKING IN SPANISH AND DIDN'T KNOW. I SUGGESTED SHE GET A SPANISH SPEAKING FLT ATTENDANT TO LISTEN IN. FLT ATTENDANT #1 CAME BACK TO THE GALLEY A FEW MINS LATER AND SAID THE SPANISH/ENGLISH SPEAKING PAX SITTING NEAR HER SAID SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT EATING HER SUITCASE. THIS WOMAN SOUNDED 'MENTALLY UNSTABLE' TO ME AND I SUGGESTED TO FLT ATTENDANT #1 THAT SHE SHOULD INFORM THE CAPT BEFORE WE DEPARTED FROM THE GATE SO THE WOMAN COULD BE REMOVED BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED IF THE CAPT SO CHOSE.

FLT ATTENDANT #2 (A SPANISH SPEAKING FLT ATTENDANT) SPOKE TO HER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS; TELLING HER TO RETURN TO HER SEAT; BE QUIET; AND STOP DISTURBING THE PEOPLE AROUND HER. ALTHOUGH SHE WOULD BE RESPONSIVE; SHE COULDN'T STAY FOCUSED ON THE 'CHORE' FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINS. ABOUT 1 HR PRIOR TO LNDG; SHE STARTED CRAWLING OVER THE SEAT BACKS HOPPING FROM ONE EMPTY SEAT INTO ANOTHER. I CALLED THE CAPT AND INFORMED HIM OF THIS NEW BEHAVIOR.

FLT ATTENDANT #2 RELATED THIS INFO TO HER; AND TOLD HER WE WOULD HAVE TO TIE HER INTO THE SEAT IF SHE COULDN'T STAY THERE. SHE BECOME LIKE A STONE; STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.

SHE APPEARED MENTALLY UNSTABLE. WE LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. IN THE RPT FROM THE AIRLINE; IT IS STATED THAT SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE MIXED ALCOHOL WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AND HER BEHAVIOR WAS A RESULT OF THIS. IN MY OPINION; THE CAPT SHOULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE SPEAK TO HER WHO IS CAPABLE OF DISCERNMENT AND AT LEAST HAD HER REMOVED UNTIL A CAPABLE PERSON COULD SPEAK WITH HER AND MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT HER ABILITY TO TRAVEL UNACCOMPANIED. ALSO; WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FLT ATTENDANTS ON BOARD WHEN WE HAVE A 'HEALTHY' LOAD TO ASSIGN SOMEONE TO BABY-SIT FOR A 'SCARY' PAX.

SHE SAID WE WERE NOT OPERATING UNDER PART 121 (UNTRUE -- SUBSEQUENTLY; I CONFIRMED WE WERE PART 121) AND THESE PEOPLE WERE MEDIA PEOPLE; WHOSE EQUIP CONTAINED SPECIAL SHIELDING; AND THEY WERE ALLOWED TO USE THEIR EQUIP (SMALL HAND-HELD RADIOS). I TOLD HER I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED BEING TOLD DURING HER BRIEFING WHICH REGS WE WERE TO FOLLOW AND WHICH REGS TO IGNORE. AS FAR AS I KNEW; OUR FLT TO BWI TOOK US OVER OUR NATION'S MOST RESTRICTIVE AND SENSITIVE AIRSPACE. I WAS UPSET AND CONCERNED. AS I PERCEIVED HER AS MY SUPERIOR; I DID NOT CHALLENGE HER BY THEN SPEAKING WITH THE CAPT. AFTER LNDG: THIS WAS A FLT WHERE I TRULY FELT THE PAX WERE TREATED AS WHAT THE COMPANY WANTS US TO CALL THEM; 'CUSTOMERS.' I FELT THE 'CUSTOMERS' HAD BEEN GIVEN CARTE BLANCHE AND SOME OF THE FAR'S IGNORED. I WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD THE 'CUSTOMERS' WERE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY. BY THE TIME WE LANDED; I FELT INEFFECTUAL TO EXERCISE ANY AUTH. DURING TAXI; I OBSERVED 2 PAX GET OUT OF THEIR SEATS; 1 PAX WALKED AROUND; STOOD IN THE AISLE AND ANOTHER PAX TOOK HIS SUITCASE OUT OF THE OVERHEAD BIN. THIS APPEARED TO BE 'BUSINESS AS USUAL.' AFTER THE FLT: I SPOKE WITH THE CAPT AT THE HOTEL. I DISCOVERED NO ONE HAD INFORMED HIM OF THE AUTH USE OF THE UNAPPROVED ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN THE CABIN. FURTHER; HE SAID THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THROUGH TESTING THAT THE USE OF UNAPPROVED ELECTRONIC DEVICES INTERFERES WITH ACFT SYS. HE SAID THEIR USE POSES VIRTUALLY NO THREAT; AND THEREFORE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEIR USE HAD HE BEEN ASKED. I DISAGREED WITH HIS OPINION. I TOLD HIM I DID NOT WANT TO FLY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. I CALLED SCHEDULING AND REQUESTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE RETURN CHARTER FLT. MY REQUEST TO BE REASSIGNED WAS GRANTED. CONCERNS: THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WAS BLURRED -- I BELIEVE THE CAPT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE FLT; FLT DECK DOOR FORWARD; BUT BEHIND THE FLT DECK DOOR; THINGS GOT BLURRED. THE CHARTER COORDINATOR ACTED IN CHARGE; AND MR X (NON-INFLT QUALIFIED) WAS AUTHORIZING THE USE OF UNAPPROVED ELECTRONIC DEVICES. THE FIRST FLT ATTENDANT; WHO WAS TECHNICALLY IN CHARGE; APPEARED UNAWARE AND UNCONCERNED. CREW COM BROKE DOWN -- I WAS TOLD BY THE CAPT; ALL WOULD BE SOP; THEN TOLD BY THE CHARTER COORDINATOR THAT THE REGS WERE DIFFERENT AND THAT PART 121 DID NOT APPLY. LATER; I DISCOVERED THE CAPT HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THE USE OF THE UNAPPROVED ELECTRONIC DEVICES. CAPT'S DISREGARD -- THE ACR'S FLT OPS MANUAL; AS WELL AS THE FAR'S; PROHIBITS THE USE OF UNAPPROVED ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN THE CABIN.

BOTH PLTS WERE ALERT AND FOCUSED AND FLYING BY THE BOOK. IN RETROSPECT; I BELIEVE THAT THE ACFT INSTS HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY CELL PHONES OR OTHER EQUIP IN THE ACFT CABIN. I MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THIS BY MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT AS WE STARTED OUR DSCNT ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ. ATC HAD MADE A BROADCAST IN THE BLIND THAT THE LIBERATION OF IRAQ HAD JUST BEGUN. THE TENSION CREATED BY IMMINENT WAR WAS ON EVERYONE'S MIND AND I WAS HAPPY TO SHARE THE NEWS WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE CABIN. HOWEVER; THE EVENTS DURING THE PAST 2 YRS HAVE SHOWN THAT CELL PHONES PROLIFERATE AND CAN BE USED FROM THE BACK OF AN AIRPLANE. I HAVE NO OTHER LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE AUTOPLT BEING LOCKED ONTO A LOC 1 MIN AND 1 MI OFF COURSE THE NEXT MOMENT. SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS COULD HAVE MADE THIS EVENT MUCH WORSE: 1) THE ATIS WAS CALLING THE WX FEW CLOUDS AT AROUND 2000 FT (I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY) AND A CEILING OF 4700 FT. THE ACTUAL CEILING ON FINAL WAS ABOUT 1800 FT. THIS HAPPENS A LOT AND SEEMS TO HAPPEN MUCH MORE OFTEN AT THE FIELDS THAT USE AUTOMATED ATIS. 2) NO WARNING WAS EVER ISSUED BY APCH CTL. WE WERE BEING HANDED OFF TO THE TWR AT THE TIME AND THE TWR DIDN'T MENTION OUR BEING OFF COURSE EITHER. 3) THE FACT THAT THE APCH REQUIRES 1 NAVAID TO BE SET TO THE VOR-DME MEANT THAT 1 PLT WAS NOT PRESENTED WITH A LOC TO MONITOR. THIS IS LESS THAN OPTIMUM ESPECIALLY FOR A CAT 3 RWY. IN THE PAST (ON 1 OCCASION) I HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN A CELL PHONE CAUSE A LOC NEEDLE TO BE CTRED WITH NO OFF FLAG WHEN THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT ON THE COURSE DURING VMC. SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTION: NEVER MAKE A PA THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE THE USE OF A CELL PHONE DURING FLT.",,,,"AN ACR B737-700 CREW; ON APCH TO BWI RWY 10; ATTRIBUTES BEING OFF COURSE TO POSSIBLE UNAUTH USE OF CELL PHONES PROMPTED BY A CABIN ANNOUNCEMENT.

THIS DEPORTEE HAD IN FACT SLASHED HIS OWN WRIST WITH A RAZOR CARTRIDGE WITH WHICH HE HAD BOARDED THE ACFT.

HE STATED IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR THE INS AGENTS TO ATTEMPT TO PLACE THE DEPORTEE ON THE ACFT WITHOUT NOTIFYING ANY CREW MEMBER. THE NORMAL PROCEDURE IS FOR THE INS TO CIRCUMVENT SECURITY AND TAKE THE DEPORTEE DIRECTLY TO THE ACFT VIA THE RAMP AND THE ACCESS LADDER TO THE JET BRIDGE. THE RPTR STATED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS INSTANCE HAD MADE IT THROUGH THE INS SCREENING IN HONG KONG AND NARITA AND WAS CAUGHT DUE TO A FALSE PASSPORT IN HIS POSSESSION UPON ENTRY INTO THE USA.

AN ADDED OBSERVATION IS THAT WHEN SHE RETURNED TO HER SEAT; SHE WAS WALKING WITH A DISABLING LIMP. I THEN LEARNED THAT SHE WAS A WHEELCHAIR PAX. THE REST OF THE FLT REMAINED UNEVENTFUL AND SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT FOR THE DURATION. UPON LNDG IN DFW; DURING TAXI IN TO THE GATE; PAX LEFT HER SEAT AND PROCEEDED TO THE AFT OF THE ACFT. THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT STOPPED PAX AND TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST REMAIN SEATED DURING TAXI UNTIL THE FASTEN SEATBELT SIGN WAS TURNED OFF. PAX THEN SAID THAT SHE HAS A MEDICAL CONDITION AFFECTING HER BLADDER AND THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP IT; BUT HAD TO USE THE LAVATORY IMMEDIATELY. WE THEN AGREED AND LET HER GO AND CALLED THE COCKPIT TO LET THEM KNOW SHE WAS IN THE LAVATORY. THEY INSTRUCTED US TO TELL HER TO TAKE A SEAT IN THE IMMEDIATE AFT OF THE ACFT AS SHE LEFT THE LAVATORY. AFTER A FEW MINS; THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT CALLED ME AND ASKED ME IF SHE WAS SMOKING IN THE LAVATORY AGAIN SINCE I WAS SITTING THERE ON THE JUMPSEAT RIGHT NEXT TO LAVATORY. I TOLD HER THAT I HAD NOT DETECTED ANY ODOR OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AT THAT TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; PAX EXITED THE LAVATORY AND I ONCE AGAIN IMMEDIATELY SMELLED CIGARETTE SMOKE COMING FROM THE LAVATORY. I IMMEDIATELY TOLD THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT WHO THEN CALLED THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT AND RPTED THE INCIDENT. THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT TOLD PAX TO SIT DOWN IN XXD AND SHE COMPLIED. THEN #1 FLT ATTENDANT CALLED BACK AND TOLD US THAT THE COCKPIT WANTED HER TO STAY ON THE ACFT AT THE GATE. ABOUT THIS TIME WE ARRIVED AT THE GATE AND I DISARMED MY DOOR AND CHKED THE LAVATORY AGAIN FOR A SMOLDERING CIGARETTE. AGAIN I FOUND NO BURNING CIGARETTES. I WENT TO SPEAK WITH PAX AND TOLD HER THAT AS SHE EXITED THE LAVATORY; I ONCE AGAIN SMELLED CIGARETTE SMOKE AND THAT SHE IS TO REMAIN ON BOARD BY THE CAPT'S ORDERS. I TOLD HER THAT THE ODOR OF CIGARETTE SMOKE WAS ONCE AGAIN UNDENIABLE AND THAT THIS IS HER SECOND OFFENSE ON ONE GIVEN FLT AND THAT A DECISION WOULD NOW HAVE TO BE MADE IF SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON HER CONNECTING FLT TO ORD. PAX WAS BECOMING VISIBLY SHAKEN AND ASKED FOR A GLASS OF WATER TO TAKE MEDICATION FOR HER ILLNESS. SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD TO SMOKE TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH HER MEDICAL CONDITION. SHE SAID SHE WAS 'BECOMING A PARAPLEGIC.' I GAVE HER SOME WATER AND SHE BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY. I TOLD HER THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING ON THE ACFT IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT IT MAY LEAD TO A FIRE. SHE THEN SAID SHE WOULD GIVE ME ALL OF HER CIGARETTES TO PROVE THAT SHE WOULD NOT SMOKE ON THE NEXT FLT AND I AGREED. SHE GAVE ME 3 PACKS OF CIGARETTES AND SHE SUGGESTED I THROW THEM AWAY IN WHICH I DID. AT THAT TIME THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT CALLED AND TOLD ME THAT THE PAX SVC SUPVR WANTED TO KNOW IF I WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES. I SAID I WOULD BE RIGHT UP AND ON MY WAY; PAX WAS NOW CRYING. I WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE ACFT AND THE PAX SVC SUPVR ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES. I SAID 'NO'; BUT THAT A DECISION MUST BE MADE BY THE ACR PAX COMPLAINT SUPVR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON HER CONNECTING FLT. I TOLD THE PAX SVC SUPVR THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP HER CIGARETTES AND THAT I TOSSED THEM IN THE TRASH. AT THAT TIME; PAX CAME TO THE FRONT ACFT DOOR AND WAS SEATED IN A WAITING WHEELCHAIR ON THE JETBRIDGE. AS SHE WAS SETTLING IN; I BEGAN TO ASK FOR HER NAME AND ADDRESS AND AS I BEGAN TO WRITE DOWN HER NAME; THE PAX SVC SUPVR INTERJECTED AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY AND THAT HE HAD ALL OF THE INFO ON HER PAX RECORD. THE PAX SVC SUPVR INFORMED ME THAT THE ACR PAX COMPLAINT SUPVR WAS ALLOWING HER TO CONTINUE ON HER CONNECTING FLT AND THAT THE CREW TO ORD WOULD BE INFORMED OF THE INCIDENT AND TO WATCH HER ACTIVITY ON HER FLT. I THEN OBTAINED A COPY OF HER PAX RECORD AS I WATCHED HER BEING TRANSPORTED TO HER NEXT GATE ON THE CART. THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER WOMAN THAT WAS TRAVELING WITH HER AND AT ONE POINT; PAX TOLD US NOT TO LET HER KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO HIM MADE EYE CONTACT AND INDICATED SHE WANTED TO MOVE SEATS. I MOVED HER 6 ROWS UP. SHE INFORMED ME HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO TOUCH HER AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND AFRAID. SHE WAS AFRAID TO DEPLANE IN STL FOR FEAR HE WOULD FOLLOW HER. I WENT TO GET MALE PASSENGER'S BOARDING PASS IN ORDER TO HAVE INFO FOR CAPT. HE AGREED TO CONTACT AGENTS IN STL. PAX HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING BOARDING PASS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN SIDE POCKET OF BAG. IT WAS MY FIRST INDICATION OF POSSIBLE INTOXICATION.

CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THOUGH THE MALE PAX ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN USING HIS CELL PHONE; HE NEVER USED OBSCENITIES AND DID NOT LASH OUT PHYSICALLY. SO; THE CAPT DECIDED THAT THE POLICE DID NOT NEED TO MEET THE PLANE; BUT THE AGENTS WOULD BE REQUESTED IN ORDER TO OBSERVE THE MALE PAX DURING HIS THREE HOUR LAYOVER TO SEE IF HE SOBERED UP ENOUGH TO BE ALLOWED ON HIS CONNECTING FLT. THE AGENTS ALSO ESCORTED THE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET FEMALE PAX TO HER CONNECTING FLT; UPGRADED HER TO FIRST CLASS; AND ENSURED THE MALE PAX DID NOT HAVE ANY FURTHER CONTACT WITH HER. BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE; THE RPTR OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE IN THE SELF CHECK-IN PROCESS. A PAX CAN CHECK IN AT HOME; PRINT OUT A BOARDING PASS; AND PROCEED TO THE ARPT. IF THE PAX IS NOT CHECKING LUGGAGE; THE ONLY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PAX WOULD BE DONE AT THE SCREENING AREA. AFTER THAT; A PAX CAN AVOID AN AGENT AT THE GATE BY UTILIZING THE ELECTRONIC GATE READER (EGR) AND BOARD THE ACFT WITHOUT ANY OTHER HUMAN CONTACT.

I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD BE DOING A SVC AND HE WOULD BE GETTING A COKE SOON. HE THEN HELD UP; TO SHOW ME; HIS BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL (I LATER FOUND OUT IT WAS A FIFTH OF SCOTCH WHISKEY). I STOPPED AND TOLD HIM; YOU CANNOT DRINK YOUR ALCOHOL ON THIS FLT. PLEASE PUT IT AWAY. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SELL YOU A DRINK LATER. HE SAID OK. I PROCEEDED UP TO FIRST CLASS AND TOLD FLT ATTENDANT #1 WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. FLT ATTENDANT #3 WAS ALSO INFORMED. I HAD ALSO INFORMED FLT ATTENDANT #4.

FLT ATTENDANT #4 TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT DRINK HIS ALCOHOL ONBOARD THE PLANE; PLEASE PUT IT AWAY. THIS IS HIS SECOND WARNING; AND HE COULD BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IF HE DID NOT PUT THE ALCOHOL AWAY. HE SAID OK; AND PUT THE BOTTLE AWAY. THE CAPT SAID OUR GND HOLD HAD BEEN LIFTED AND WE WERE GOING TO DEPART AS SOON AS WE COULD GET THE CABIN READY. AFTER TKOF; I GOT THE CART READY AND WE STARTED OUR SVC AT ROW Y. THIS IS WHEN FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND I FIRST NOTICED HOW INTOXICATED THE PAX IN SEATS XXA AND XXB WERE. THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING THE ALCOHOL THE WHOLE TIME. I NEVER SAW THEM TAKE A DRINK FROM THE BOTTLE; HOWEVER; THE PAX IN XXC SAW THEM. SHE LATER TOLD US THEY WERE DRINKING FROM THE BOTTLE THE ENTIRE TIME; EVEN AFTER WE TOLD THEM NOT TO. SO; WE CONTINUED OUR SVC. WHEN FLT ATTENDANT #4 GOT TO ROW XX; THE PAX IN XXA WAS STARTING TO USE FOUL LANGUAGE; AND HIS ARMS WERE FLYING EVERYWHERE. FLT ATTENDANT #4 TRIED TO SETTLE HIM DOWN. I INFORMED FLT ATTENDANT #2; AND HE WAS UPDATING THE CAPT. FLT ATTENDANT #1 AND I WERE IN THE BACK GALLEY WHEN THE PAX IN XXA GOT UP TO GO TO THE LAVATORY. I DIDN'T SEE HIM ACCIDENTALLY HIT A PAX THAT WAS SITTING IN AN AISLE SEAT. HE STARTED TO WALK STAGGERING THE WHOLE WAY. HE MADE IT INTO THE LAVATORY; AND WE CLOSED THE DOOR FOR HIM. HE WAS UNABLE TO LOCK THE DOOR. BY THIS TIME WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE PAX GETTING HIT BY HIM. WE GOT HER ICE. I HEARD HIM IN THE LAVATORY POUNDING ON THE DOOR AND THE WALLS; MAKING NOISES. FLT ATTENDANT #4 WALKED HIM BACK TO HIS SEAT. A LITTLE WHILE LATER THE PAX IN XXB GOT OUT OF HIS SEAT AND STARTED WALKING TOWARDS THE LAVATORY; HOWEVER; HE JUST MADE IT TO THE LAVATORY AND HE STARTED TO THROW UP NEVER CLOSING THE DOOR. AFTER HE WAS FINISHED HE WALKED BACK TO HIS SEAT. I THEN CLOSED AND LOCKED THE BACK LAVATORY; SO NO OTHER PAX COULD USE IT. WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON; THE PAX SEATED IN XXC COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE; SO I BROUGHT HER BACK TO MY JUMPSEAT AND CALLED THE CAPT MYSELF. GAVE HIM AN UPDATE; AND HE HAD NO PROB WITH HER SITTING IN MY JUMPSEAT. THE CAPT WANTED ME TO TRY AND FIND 2 ABLE GUYS TO HELP US IF WE NEEDED THEM. HE ALSO SAID THE FLT WOULD BE MET BY THE POLICE. CALL LIGHTS WERE GOING OFF ALL AROUND THESE 2 PAX. ABOUT 1 HR AND 30 MINS BEFORE LNDG; THE PAX IN XXA STARTED POUNDING THE SEAT IN FRONT OF HIM. SO FLT ATTENDANT #4 AND MYSELF USED BOTH OUR FLEX CUFFS TO KEEP HIS HANDS FROM MOVING. CUFFED HIS HANDS AND THEN CUFFED HIM TO THE TRAY TABLE. NOT SURE WHEN; BUT THE PAX IN XXB STARTED TO THROW UP IN HIS SEAT. SO FLT ATTENDANT #4 GOT HIM A BAG; HOWEVER; IT WAS ALREADY ALL OVER HIM; THE SEAT NEXT TO HIM; SEATBACK PACKET. WE COVERED HIM WITH EXTRA PILLOW CASES I FOUND IN THE BACK. WE HAD NO EXTRA BLANKETS; THEY WERE ALL BEING USED BY OTHER PAX. NOT SURE WHEN; BUT I THINK THE PAX IN SEAT XXA ALSO THREW UP ALL OVER HIMSELF. AFTER WE LANDED; THE CAPT MADE A PA STATING THAT ALL PAX REMAIN SEATED SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS COULD COME ONBOARD. AFTER ALL THE PAX DEPLANED; THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS PROCEEDED TO HANDCUFF THE PAX IN XXA AND XXB. THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK THE PAX IN XXB OFFTHE PLANE; HOWEVER; THE PAX IN XXA HAD TO BE REMOVED WITH THE AISLE CHAIR.

ONE OF THE FLT ATTENDANTS HAD ALREADY BROUGHT THE ENHANCED MEDICAL KIT; REGULAR MEDICAL KIT; AND AED FROM FIRST CLASS GALLEY. THE DOCTOR TRIED TO CALM AND WORK WITH PAX. THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ME AND STATED 'SHE IS ACUTELY PSYCHOTIC. I NEED TO SEE WHAT IS IN THE ENHANCED MEDICAL KIT.' DOCTOR STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE A INJECTION FOR FAST RESULTS; AS HER BEHAVIOR WAS TURNING 'MALICIOUS.' DOCTOR ADMINISTERED; BY INJECTION; 10 MG OF DIAZEPAM.

I ASKED THE CAPT 'WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH HIS WIFE'S SIT OF THREATS; INTIMIDATIONS; PHYSICAL PULLING AND HITTING?' CAPT SAID THAT 'CUSTOMER SVC PROBABLY WANTS US TO KNOW HOW MUCH HER HUSBAND FLIES WITH OUR COMPANY.' I AGAIN STATED THAT THE ACARS MESSAGE WAS NOT RELEVANT TO SIT. I STATED THAT 'I PERCEIVED IT AS A THREAT FROM COMPANY MGMNT NOT TO PROCEED WITH HAVING THE FLT MET.' I TOLD CAPT I WOULD ADVISE CREW (FLT ATTENDANTS) OF MESSAGE AND THAT I WANTED A COPY. THE FLT LANDED IN EGLL WITHOUT INCIDENT. LONDON POLICE AND PARAMEDICS MET FLT. THE FLT ATTENDANTS; INCLUDING MYSELF; DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES AS A RESULT OF COMPANY'S INTERFERENCE AND WHAT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE THREATENING IF WE WERE TO FILE. WE WERE; AND STILL ARE; AFRAID THAT THE COMPANY WILL POSSIBLY DISCIPLINE US OR EVEN FIRE/TERMINATE US FOR RPTING AN INCIDENT WHICH INVOLVED A HIGH VOLUME FREQUENT FLYER. THE HUSBAND WAS ALWAYS CORDIAL AND APOLOGETIC; NEVER MENTIONING THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. SIMPLY PUT; IT IS MY OPINION THAT COMPANY WAS NOT GOING TO BACK US; THAT COMPANY WAS DISCOURAGING US FROM PRESSING CHARGES. COMPANY'S INTIMIDATION TACTICS WORKED! WE DID NOT FILE CHARGES. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 604607: ALL FLT ATTENDANTS IN BUSINESS CLASS AGREED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A MENTAL PROB AND FLT ATTENDANT PUT AWAY ALL GLASS IN THE GALLEY AS A PRECAUTION. PURSER INFORMED ME SHE HURT HIM AND TOLD US TO GET OUR HANDCUFFS OUT. HER HUSBAND FROM BUSINESS CLASS WAS WITH HER AT THIS TIME AND SHE SCRATCHED HIM TO THE POINT YOU COULD SEE BLOOD.

WHEN I LOOKED BACK OVER TO MY PRIMARY FLT INSTS; I NOTICED WE HAD FLOWN THROUGH OUR INBOUND COURSE; AND THE ACFT WAS IN A 30 DEG L-HAND BANK.

HE WAS VIOLENTLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF HIS SEAT; BUT HE HAD HIS SEATBELT STILL ON HIM. I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OK; AND HE DID NOT RESPOND OR LOOK AT ME; AS IF I WERE NOT THERE. CONCERNED THAT HE WAS HURTING HIMSELF AND PROBABLY ONLY HAD TO USE THE LAVATORY; I UNSNAPPED HIS SEATBELT AND HE GOT UP AND PROCEEDED AFT. SOMETHING TOLD ME TO FOLLOW HIM. THE #1; #2 AND #4 FLT ATTENDANTS WERE IN THE GALLEY. I MOTIONED TO THEM AS HE AND I WERE NEAR THE GALLEY/BATHROOM AREA THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM. HE PASSED THE BATHROOMS AND PROCEEDED INTO THE AFT GALLEY; WHERE HE JUST STOOD THERE. I TOLD THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT; WHO WAS THE SPEAKER; THAT MAYBE HE DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND TO TELL HIM WHERE THE BATHROOM IS. SHE SAID SOMETHING IN SPANISH. AGAIN HE DID NOT RESPOND; JUST LOOKING. JUST AS SHE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AWE; HE REACHED OUT AND WENT TO THE 3L DOOR. I SHOUTED TO THE #2 FLT ATTENDANTS 'HE'S GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR!' SHE TRIED TO STEP SOMEWHAT BTWN HIM AND THE DOOR AND HELD OUT HER HAND TO STOP HIM. SUDDENLY HE YELLED AND SMACKED HER IN THE FACE. HE THEN STARTED TO GRAB; PUSHING AND PULLING HER IN AND AT THE FACE VERY VIOLENTLY. HE WAS GRUNTING LOUDLY. AFTER A SECOND OR TWO OF BEING IN SHOCK; I WENT TO TRY TO PULL THE MAN OFF OF THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT. HE WAS EXTREMELY STRONG. HE WAS ABOUT 5 FT 6 INCHES TO 5 FT 7 INCHES; 160-170 LBS; AND MID-TO-LATE 60'S. I BEGAN TO PULL HIM. HE THEN TURNED AND WENT AFTER ME; PUSHING ME INTO DOOR 3R AREA. I BELIEVE HE STILL HAD A HAND ON HER. WE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH THE MAN. I YELLED TO GET HIM DOWN; AND AS WE STARTED WRESTLING TO GND; HE GRABBED MY R LEG; BTWN MY ANKLE AND SHIN; AND WAS TRYING TO BRING IT TO HIS MOUTH. I WAS ABLE TO FREE MY LEG AND WE CONTINUED TO FIGHT WITH HIM TO KEEP HIM NEAR/ON THE FLOOR. ONE OF US SHOUTED FOR THE CUFFS. AS THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT WENT FOR HER CUFFS AND MAN (HELPER) CAME AND WAS WRIGGLING HIS WAY BTWN SHE AND I TO HELP HOLD HIM DOWN. THE #4 FLT ATTENDANT RETURNED WITH THE CUFFS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER MEN (HELPERS). ONCE THE HELPERS HAD HOLD OF HIM; I MOVED BACK TO THE LAVATORY AREA. I CHIMED THE COCKPIT TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS SHAKING SO THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAID. I THEN REALIZED THAT ANOTHER FLT ATTENDANT WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM ALREADY. I THEN THOUGHT AND PAGED FOR A DOCTOR OR NURSE. I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE AFT PART OF THE CABIN WAS UP IN THE AISLE AND I COULD NOT SEE IF ANYONE WAS COMING AND MADE ANOTHER PA FOR EVERYONE TO SIT DOWN AND EVERYTHING WAS OK. NO ONE CAME. I TURNED BACK TO THE INCIDENT; TO SEE THE HELPERS STRUGGLING STILL WITH THE MAN. HIS LEGS WERE FLAILING AND KICKING. I ASKED IF I SHOULD GET MY CUFFS FOR HIS ANKLE AND ALL AGREED. I WENT TO DOOR 2L TO GET MINE; AND AS I WAS COMING BACK; A MAN IN THE LHS WINDOW EXIT SAID HE WAS AN EMT AND IF I NEEDED HIS HELP. I TOOK HIM BACK AND BY THIS TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE WHO ENDED UP BEING A PHARMACIST STANDING THERE. I TOLD THE GALLEY CROWD THAT THIS MAN WAS AN EMT. HE GOT INTO THE SITUATION. I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NOW LIQUID FLOWING ON THE FLOOR. I ASKED THE CROWD WHAT WAS THAT; AND ONE OF THE HELPERS RESPONDED THAT IT WAS URINE. I GAVE MY CUFFS TO THE HELPER AND HE AND ANOTHER PUT THEM ON. I MADE SURE TO TELL HIM TO CHK TO SEE THAT HE SHOULD GET 1 FINGER BTWN THE CUFFS AND THE ANKLES. I NOTICED THAT THE MAN HAD ON 1 SHOE AT THIS POINT AND HIS FEET LOOKED SWOLLEN. I TOLD A HELPER TO REMOVE THE OTHER SHOE. I WAS CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT HURT SOMEONE WITH THE SHOE STILL ON HIS FOOT. THE HELPER DID AND THE GUY REPEATEDLY TOLD HIM TO PUT IT BACK ON. I TOLD THE HELPER TO DO SO. THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT ASKED ME TO GET THE OXYGEN AND I GOT THE ONE FROM THE LHS DOGHOUSE. I TURNED IT ON; PINCHED THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO THE WOMAN. THE CAPT MADE THE PREPARE FOR LNDG ANNOUNCEMENT AND I WENT FORWARD TO DO MORE CHKS. WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS; REPEAT 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ON THIS FLT. FORTUNATELY; DURING BOARDING WE WERE ABLE TO GET THEM TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR TWO. I MOVED THE 2 TO FIRST CLASS; CLRED 36A-C; 35A-C TO FIRST CLASS TO ACCOMMODATE THE MAN AND THE HELPERS. WE SEATED THE MAN IN 36A; AND HELPERS IN 36BCD AND IN 35A&C. I ALSO WENT BACK TO THE COUPLE THAT WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM AND ASKED IF HE HAD ANY BAGS AND WAS HE WITH THEM. THEY SAID NO TO EACH QUESTION; SAYING THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM IN THE BOARDING AREA AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BAGS WITH HIM. WHEN WE LANDED; WE WERE MET BY SOME TJSJ SUPVRS AND LOTS OF POLICE AND SOME PARAMEDICS. PARAMEDICS BOARDED AND TOOK HIM OFF. HIS DEMEANOR WAS NORMAL -- TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF THE ANGER WE HAD SEEN -- AND HIS APPEARANCE PHYSICALLY LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN A FIGHT AND HE HAD ON 1 SET OF CUFFS ON HIS WRISTS. THE #2 FLT ATTENDANT AND I SPOKE TO POLICE AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO TAKE US TO THE STATION SINCE THIS WAS NOW AN FBI SITUATION. AFTER DEPLANING THE PAX AND THE 15 UNACCOMPANIED MINORS; SHE AND I WENT TO THE TJSJ POLICE STATION AT THE ARPT. WE WERE THERE OVER 3 HRS.

DURING INITIAL CLBOUT; I REALIZED THAT MY DIRECTIONAL GYRO WAS TUMBLING AND NOT WORKING. I WAS THEN CLRED DIRECT TO ABC VOR. I LOOKED AND REACHED OVER TO MY NAV RADIO TO FLIP-FLOP MY VOR FREQ AND DIAL IN MY NEW HDG ON THE VOR.

I TRIED TO TELL THEM I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT-SIDE UP. THIS; I THINK; WAS THE LAST COM FOR SEVERAL SECONDS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WOULD NOT STOP VIOLENTLY SCREAMING AND I COULD NOT HEAR ATC. I THEN DECIDED THAT I NEEDED TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO REGAIN CTL. I PROCEEDED TO REACH OVER AND PUNCH MY HUSBAND IN THE FACE AND PULLED HIS BEARD TO DISRUPT HIS CURRENT AND EXTREME PANIC.

I FINALLY GOT MYSELF IN A WINGS LEVEL CLB TO 7000 FT. DURING THIS TIME; ATC ASKED WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I SAID; 'GET TO VFR OR ON THE GND.' AT THAT MOMENT; ATC INITIATED AN EMER ASR ASSIST (THANK GOD FOR GOOD CTLRS.) DURING THIS ASSIST; I WAS TRYING TO RESET MY DIRECTIONAL GYRO. FROM HENCEFORTH; I WAS ABLE TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED ACTIONS OF ATC.

I BELIEVE THE CHIEF PURSER DID NOT KNOW AS WELL. ONLY AFTER TKOF; ABOUT 20-30 MINS INTO THE FLT; DID SHE CALL THE COCKPIT AND ADVISE ME OF A PAX WITH 'MENTAL PROBS/ISSUES.' SHE SAID HE WAS BEING ESCORTED BY A FRIEND OR RELATIVE. I ONLY LEARNED OF THAT BECAUSE SHE ALERTED ME THAT HE WAS BECOMING A BEHAVIORAL PROB AND BOTHERING OTHER PAX AROUND HIM. I RECOMMENDED SHE MOVE SURROUNDING PAX FROM HIS AREA SINCE WE HAD OPEN SEATS. AFTER THE FIRST CALL FROM THE CHIEF PURSER I RELATED THAT INFO AND SEAT ASSIGNMENTS TO DISPATCH AND ASKED FOR INFO ON BOTH PAX. THE DISPATCHER THEN TOLD ME HE HAD A NOTE ON THE MANIFEST ABOUT MENTAL PROBS OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT REGARDING ONE OF THE PAX IN QUESTION. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRUDENT FOR ME TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PRIOR TO TKOF. MISTAKE/OVERSIGHT #1! DURING A FOLLOW-UP CALL TO THE CHIEF PURSER A FEW MINS LATER; I WAS ADVISED THAT THE PAX HAD SETTLED DOWN A BIT AND SHE BELIEVED THINGS WOULD BE OK. DISPATCHER ASKED ME DURING MY FIRST INQUIRY IF I HAD A SECURITY ALERT. I ANSWERED NO AT THAT TIME. I HAD ONLY VAGUE AND UN-ALARMING INFO AT THAT POINT IN TIME. A SHORT TIME LATER THE CHIEF PURSER CALLED ME AGAIN AND I WAS ADVISED THAT THE PAX WAS GETTING VERBALLY UNRULY WITH SURROUNDING PAX AND FLT ATTENDANTS. I ADVISED HER TO RECRUIT HELPERS; ONE BEING DEADHEADING CAPT; AND I MENTIONED TO HER THAT THERE WERE A FEW BIG SPORTS PLAYERS IN FIRST CLASS IF SHE NEEDED THEM FOR ASSISTANCE AND SHE SHOULD ASK THEM. I WAS TOLD THAT CAPT WENT BACK TO STAY WITH THE PAX AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER WAS TOLD THAT THE PAX STRUCK THE CAPT AND SHOVED THE CHIEF PURSER AND HE WAS UP AND IN THE AISLE. THESE NEW EVENTS OCCURRED ABOUT 30 MINS FROM ORD. I THEN NOTIFIED DISPATCH OF 'SECURITY LEVEL 2.' I ALSO ASKED HIM FOR SECURITY AND CUSTOMER SVC REPRESENTATIVE TO MEET THE ACFT. I PROCEEDED TO ASK FOR EXPEDITIOUS HANDLING TO ORD FROM ATC DUE TO 'SECURITY THREAT.' I ALSO REQUESTED RWY 22R DUE TO ITS CLOSE PROX TO THE GATES. (ORD WAS LNDG TO THE E WITH LIGHT WINDS.) I ASKED ATC TO HAVE MEDICAL AND SECURITY STANDING BY ON ARR AS WELL. I RECEIVED EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR FROM ATC. I QUICKLY FLEW DIRECTLY TO ORD WITH THE INTENTION OF REMOVING THE PAX ASAP AND RECEIVING MEDICAL ATTN TO INJURED PAX OR CREW MEMBERS. NATURALLY; I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH THINGS COULD ESCALATE OR IF THIS WAS A RUSE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GROW INTO SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS. I BELIEVED WE HAD AN URGENT SITUATION AND FELT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO REMOVE THE THREATENING PAX ASAP. MY CONCERN WAS TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE INJURIES AND TO PREVENT IT FROM MOVING TO A HIGHER SECURITY THREAT LEVEL. AFTER LNDG; I ARRIVED AT THE GATE WITHIN APPROX 30 SECONDS AND OBSERVED ALL APPROPRIATE EMER VEHICLES NEAR THE GATE. I MADE A STERN PA ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PAX TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER PARKING AND I WOULD TURN OFF THE SEATBELT SIGN WHEN APPROPRIATE. I BELIEVE THEY REALIZED FROM THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THAT WE HAD A SECURITY ISSUE AND SECURITY PERSONNEL WERE GOING TO BOARD THE ACFT. AFTER PARKING AT THE GATE I WAS EXPECTING THE JETWAY TO BE POSITIONED QUICKLY AND TO HAVE SECURITY AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL STANDING BY ON THE JETWAY. I WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THAT IT TOOK 2-3 MINS (MAYBE LONGER) FOR THE JETWAY TO POS TO THE ACFT. WE WERE WAITING FOR A JETWAY DRIVER! LUCKILY THIS SECURITY THREAT DID NOT ESCALATE BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN. WHAT IF PAX WERE BEING INJURED OR WORSE YET KILLED AND WE COULD NOT GET THE JETWAY TO THE ACFT? WAITING FOR THOSE FEW EXTRA MINS COULD HAVE HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE PAX'S SAFETY. THE LEGAL AND MORAL RAMIFICATIONS ARE TREMENDOUS. I ALSO MUST SAY THAT I AM SURE THE PAX WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE FLT CREW'S PROFESSIONALISM AND DEGREE OF URGENCY WITH WHICH THE SITUATION WAS HANDLED; AIRBORNE AND WITH TAXI IN. UNFORTUNATELY; AFTER PARKING AND WAITING FOR A JETWAY DRIVER I AM SURE THEIR RESPECT FOR AIRLINE X DIMINISHED DRAMATICALLY.",,,,"B757 CREW EXPERIENCED PAX DISRUPTION AND PERCEIVED SECURITY THREAT ENROUTE.",

PAX IN X3G (WAS UNWILLING TO GIVE ME HIS NAME ANY TIME DURING THIS INCIDENT) WAS STANDING WITH A PLASTIC CUP OF WATER IN HAND. I HANDED HIM THE SNACK AND SAID 'ENJOY.' HE THEN PROCEEDED TO WAKE HIS WIFE AT WHICH POINT I QUIETLY SUGGESTED TO HIM TO LET HER SLEEP AS WE ONLY ARE CATERED WITH A MINIMUM NUMBER OF SNACKS ONLY FOR THOSE PAX WHO ARE AWAKE AND THAT IF SHE WAKES UP; I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BRING HER A SNACK.

I ADVISED HIM THAT THE INCIDENT HAD NOW 'GOTTEN OUT OF HAND AND IT HAD TO BE DOCUMENTED AND THE CAPT NEEDED TO BE INFORMED.' PAX WAS REEKING OF ALCOHOL. HE WAS SLURRING HIS WORDS AND DISPLAYED A SOMEWHAT VIOLENT ATTITUDE. PAX SEEMED VERY AGITATED BUT INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS A LOYAL CUSTOMER AT WHICH I SAID; I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT THAT JUST TRANSPIRED. HE CONTINUED TO RANT AS I CONTINUED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE POLICIES THAT WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AS HE CHOSE TO USE 'FORCE' ON ME. HE REQUESTED THE PURSER AT WHICH I TOLD HIM THE PURSER WAS ON HIS BREAK AND COULDN'T BE DISTURBED BUT I TOLD HIM THE CAPT WILL BE ADVISED AS TO HIS BEHAVIOR AND NOTIFIED OF THIS SITUATION AND THAT IF THE CAPT FEELS THAT THE SAFETY OF PAX AND CREW IS BEING JEOPARDIZED; WE COULD POSSIBLY BE FORCED TO LAND THE FLT IN THE CLOSEST CITY ON THE WEST COAST; POSSIBLY SAN FRANCISCO. I LEFT THE PAX TO GO TO FIRST CLASS AND RETRIEVE A BLANK PAX INFLT DISTURBANCE RPT AND FOUND THAT THE PURSER HADN'T RETIRED TO THE CREW BUNKS FOR HIS BREAK AND IMMEDIATELY EXPLAINED THAT WE HAD A 'SIT' IN THE MAIN CABIN. HE SAID THE CAPT WAS IN THE RESTROOM AND AS SOON AS HE CAME OUT; WE WOULD DISCUSS IT WITH HIM. WHEN CAPT EMERGED FROM THE RESTROOM; I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION; DESCRIBING THE PUSHING/SHOVING INCIDENT. HE SAID THAT SINCE IT HAD ESCALATED TO THIS LEVEL; A DISTURBANCE RPT WAS APPROPRIATE. I RETURNED TO PAX WITH THE FORM AND REQUESTED THAT I SEE SOME IDENT TO COMPLETE THE FORM. PAX REFUSED TELLING ME THAT 'HE WASN'T GOING TO GIVE ME A 'EXPLETIVE' THING BECAUSE IT WAS ME WHO HAD PUSHED HIM.' HIS WIFE THEN CHIMED IN; STATING THE SAME THING ALONG WITH 2 OTHER PAX SEATED IN THE H AND J SEATS (HIS WIFE WAS ASLEEP WHEN THE SHOVING INCIDENT TOOK PLACE SO SHE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN HIM SHOVE ME AND THE 2 PAX IN THE H AND J SEATS DIDN'T HAVE A CLR VIEW AS I WAS IN THE AISLE BLOCKING THEIR VIEW --THIS WAS TOTALLY BOGUS!).

SINCE PAX WAS BEING UNCOOPERATIVE REGARDING COMPLETING THE INFLT DISTURBANCE FORM; I RETURNED TO EXPLAIN FURTHER THE SITUATION TO THE PURSER AND THE CAPT. CAPT THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PURSER GO AND INQUIRE JUST WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED. I RETURNED TO THE MAIN CABIN; REQUESTED THAT PAX IN X5G COME WITH ME TO THE AFT OF THE PLANE SO I COULD OBTAIN THE NECESSARY INFO FROM HIM AS HE WAS THE ONLY PAX TO HAVE A CLR VIEW OF THE ACTUAL EVENT AND HOW IT TRANSPIRED. HE STATED THAT HE HAD A CLR VIEW OF THE ENTIRE INCIDENT AND YES; PAX SHOVED/PUSHED ME. I THANKED HIM FOR THE INFO AND TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD FORWARD IT TO THE COMPANY. HE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT. PURSER THEN EXPLAINED TO PAX THAT INCIDENT THAT HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE WAS A VIOLATION AND THAT THE AUTHS WILL NOW MEET THE FLT AND IT WILL BE IN HIS HANDS. AS I WAS NOT A WITNESS TO THIS; I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED BTWN THE PURSER AND PAX; HOWEVER; ACCORDING TO THE PURSER; PAX CONFESSED THAT HE 'MAY HAVE GENTLY PUSHED' THE MALE FLT ATTENDANT AND IT WAS A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING. ACCORDING TO THE PURSER; PAX WAS NERVOUS AND SHAKING AND COMPLIED WITH THE REQUEST; SUPPLYING HIM WITH HIS NAME; ADDRESS AND IDENT. HE ALSO SAID THAT PAX APOLOGIZED FOR THE COMMOTION HE INSTIGATED. PURSER THEN ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO PURSUE THE INCIDENT AND HAVE THE AUTHS MEET THE FLT. I WAS RELUCTANT/HESITANT TO DO SO AS THE ENTIRE FLT LOAD OF PAX WERE RETURNING HOME AND THAT BY HAVING THE AUTHS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WOULD ONLY DELAY THEIR ARR AND EVENTUAL REUNIONS WITH THEIR FAMILIES; FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES.

I AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS ONE OF THE PAX IN THE OTHER 2 SEATS (F AND D) MIGHT NOT MIND IF HER PET CARRIER WENT UNDER THE SEATS IN FRONT OF THEM FOR TKOF AND LNDG. I ASKED THE PAX IN XXD; WHO SAID SHE DIDN'T MIND; YET MS X CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN THAT HER BAG WAS 'AIRLINE APPROVED' AND SHE HAS 'PAID' TO HAVE IT WITH HER.

MS X CONTINUED SCREAMING AT ME WHEN MS Y (IN B) TURNED TO HER AND SAID 'CUT IT OUT; SHE HAS ALREADY TOLD YOU 4 TIMES TO PUT YOUR BAG UNDER A SEAT.' AT THAT TIME I GENTLY PLACED THE BAG UNDER B; SO WE COULD SAFELY TAKE OFF.

APPROX IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CABIN I FELT UNSAFE TO WALK ANY LONGER SO I SQUATTED AND EVEN WITHOUT REQUESTING ASSISTANCE THE PAX TO MY R AND L HELD ME DOWN.

THE PURSER HAD ASKED THE PAX IF THEY WOULD MIND MOVING TO THE WINDOW SEAT SO THAT THE IMPROVISED FOOT REST WOULDN'T BLOCK THE EXIT PATH IN FRONT OF THE SEAT. THE PAX REPLIED THAT THEIR DISABILITY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SIT IN THE WINDOW SEAT. AT THIS POINT THE PURSER BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO ME. SINCE WE WERE STILL AT THE GATE; THIS WAS A CUSTOMER SVC ISSUE SO I WENT OUT TO THE GATE AREA TO ADVISE OUR CUSTOMER SVC REPS THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND SOME SOLUTION TO THIS BECAUSE WE COULDN'T HAVE EXIT SPACE IN FRONT OF THIS PAX'S SEAT BLOCKED PER FAR. THE PAX AGENT IMMEDIATELY KNEW TO WHICH PAX I WAS REFERRING AND QUICKLY REFUSED TO DEAL WITH THE PROB BECAUSE 1) THIS PAX WORKS IN A FEDERAL GOV AGENCY AND 2) BECAUSE THE PAX IS AT OUR COMPANY'S HIGHEST LEVEL OF FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. THEY SAID THE PAX WAS 'A LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN' AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED FOR RISK OF THEIR JOBS. A CSR SUPVR WAS CALLED AS WAS A FLT OPS SUPVR TO DEAL WITH THE PROB. WE ENDED UP GOING BACK DOWN TO THE AIRPLANE AND HAD 5 PEOPLE CRAMMED IN THE COCKPIT OF MY B757 (2 PLTS; THE PURSER AND 2 SUPVRS) DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO. ACTUALLY; IT TURNED MORE INTO A NEGOTIATION OF WHAT WE COULD GET AWAY WITH WITHOUT ANNOYING THE PAX. I FINALLY GOT ACROSS TO THE CSR SUPVR THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL TO HAVE THE AREA IN FRONT OF THIS PAX'S SEAT BLOCKED FOR TAXI; TKOF AND LNDG AND THAT THE PAX'S FREQUENT FLYER STATUS AND POS IN THE FEDERAL GOV DIDN'T CHANGE THAT. THE SUPVR THEN WENT BACK AND ASKED THE PAX IF THEY WOULD MIND IF THE CUSHIONS WERE STOWED DURING THOSE CRITICAL PHASES OF FLT AND THE PAX SAID OK AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT; BUT WE TOOK AN 18 MIN DELAY DEALING WITH WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE PROB EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE CSR'S AND THEIR SUPVR WERE MORE FEARFUL OF THE GOVT AND THIS PAX'S HIGH MILEAGE STATUS THAN THEY WERE ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FAR. I BELIEVE THIS IS GENERALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE SITUATION AT ALL CARRIERS TODAY. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE PAX HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW THE PILLOWS/CUSHIONS TO BE STOWED; I WASN'T GOING TO LEAVE THE GATE LIKE THAT. I NEED TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN THE PURSER WAS ORIGINALLY TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION ON HER OWN WITH THE PAX; THE PAX SAID THAT THEY FLEW A ROUND TRIP FROM ZZZ1 TO ZZZ2 EVERY WK AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY HAD SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AT SOME POINT; THE AVIATION INDUSTRY HAS BEEN NUDGED OUT OF AIRLINE OPS AND THE FOCUS HAS TURNED; OUT OF PROPORTION; TO 'DIVERSITY;' ADA ISSUES AND/OR EMPHASIS TO THE EXTREME ON HIGH MILEAGE FREQUENT FLYERS TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S AFFECTING NOT JUST THE GATE PERSONNEL; BUT ALSO FLT AND CABIN CREWS.

HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO INTEREST HER IN DRUGS AND WAS ESCALATING HIS RHETORIC. I CALLED FOR AN AGENT AND SECURITY TO ACCOMPANY THEM. THE RESPONSE WAS A MALE AGENT WHO I ASKED TO TALK TO THE FLT ATTENDANT INVOLVED FOR INFO AND THEN REMOVE THE PAX. THE AGENT WAS ADVISED THAT THE PAX HAD DILATED EYES AND WAS ACTING ABUSIVE AND IRRATIONAL. WHEN THE PAX WAS BROUGHT TO THE JETBRIDGE; HE WAS EMPHATIC THAT HE WANTED TO REMAIN ON THE PLANE. AT THIS POINT; THE AGENTS WANTED TO RE-BOARD HIM AND SIMPLY CHANGE HIS SEAT TO ANOTHER. AT THIS POINT; THE #1 FLT ATTENDANT HAD TO ENTER THE ARGUMENT TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. NOW THE ONLY CONCERN OF THE AGENTS WAS TO CLOSE THE DOOR AND DEPART. I INFORMED THEM THAT I HAD YET TO ASCERTAIN IF THE ABUSED PAX WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES AND REQUIRED POLICE INVOLVEMENT. AFTER ACCOMPLISHING THIS; I ASKED WHY NO SECURITY PERSONNEL HAD BEEN CALLED; AS THE SITUATION ON THE JETBRIDGE APPEARED CLOSE TO BECOMING PHYSICAL; BUT NEVER GOT AN ANSWER. WHILE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF BOARDING; A SITUATION DEVELOPED BTWN PAX THAT I DETERMINED NEEDED INTERVENTION. I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO ANSWER. I THEN SWITCHED TO RAMP CTL AND REQUESTED SECURITY TO COME TO MY PLANE. THEY TOLD ME TO MAKE MY REQUEST TO OPS. I INFORMED THEM OPS WAS NOT RESPONDING; SO THEY FORWARDED MY REQUEST. SOMETIME LATER DURING THE EVENT; IT BECAME APPARENT THAT IT WAS ESCALATING; AND ONLY AN AGENT HAD RESPONDED. I AGAIN CALLED OPS TO REQUEST POLICE RESPONSE. THIS TIME; AN AGENT ANSWERED BUT WAS VERY CONFUSED; ASKING IF THE POLICE WERE ALREADY AT THE GATE. I EMPHATICALLY SAID NO; I NEEDED THEM TO BE CALLED. AT THIS POINT; THE AGENT KEYED THE MIKE BUTTON AND HELD IT FOR WHAT SEEMED SEVERAL MINS. SOMEONE IN THE BACKGND AT OPS COULD BE HEARD TELLING THE AGENT TO LET GO OF THE MIKE. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE AGENT SAYING OVER THE AIR SEVERAL TIMES THAT IT WASN'T THEM. WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY CONVINCED TO CHK THEIR MIKE; THE FREQ ONCE AGAIN BECAME USABLE. I AGAIN REQUESTED POLICE RESPONSE; BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER. REPEAT PLEA -- NO ANSWER. I THEN ASKED FOR THE AGENT'S INITIALS OR EMPLOYEE NUMBER FOR MY RPT -- FREQ REMAINED DEAD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENT. REQUEST WAS PASSED THROUGH RAMP CTL WHO WAS BUSY CLRING OTHER FLTS FOR PUSH/TAXI. OPS AGENT WAS CLEARLY OVERMATCHED FOR THE SIMPLE TASK OF RELAYING A REQUEST FOR SECURITY.

ALL BOARDED AT THE REAR OF THE ACFT EXCEPT FOR 1 WOMAN; WHOSE OBESITY REQUIRED A LARGER SEAT IN THE FORWARD CABIN. THE SECURITY PERSONNEL CONSIDERED THIS PAX TO BE A HIGH RISK INDIVIDUAL. SHE WAS FORCEFULLY BROUGHT UP THE STAIRS AND AGGRESSIVELY POSITIONED INTO A SEAT AFT OF THE BULKHEAD PARTITION. ANOTHER PAX WAS REMOVED DURING THE BOARDING PROCESS BECAUSE OF HIS VIOLENT MANNER DURING ENTRY. 2 GUARDS WERE INJURED; A BROKEN FINGER; AND A SMALL LACERATION TO A FOREARM. THE WOMAN DIRECTED A VULGAR VERBAL ATTACK TOWARD THE SECURITY INDIVIDUALS RESULTING IN A STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CABIN CREW. 2 CABIN ATTENDANTS BECAME UPSET BY THIS DISPLAY OF BEHAVIOR AND WERE SOMEWHAT TRAUMATIZED BY THIS EVENT. BOTH WERE UNAWARE OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS MISSION AND IT TOOK PERSONAL COUNSELING TO SUBDUE THEIR CONCERNS. DURING TAXI; AN UPRISING IN THE REAR OF THE ACFT BY SEVERAL DETAINEES REQUIRED INTERVENTION BY THE SECURITY TEAM. THE TEAM MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY COMMANDED THE CABIN ATTENDANTS TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE MID GALLEY AS THEY FORCEFULLY EXTRICATED THE PAX FROM THEIR SEATS AND REPOSITIONED THEM BTWN OTHER GUARDS. THE CABIN ATTENDANTS DESCRIBED THE SITUATION AS CHAOTIC AND DID OBSERVE THE SECURITY GUARDS USING FORCE AS NECESSARY TO NEUTRALIZE THE CONFLICTS. DURING FLT; PAX BECAME UNRULY AS THEY CONTINUED LASHING OUT TOWARD THE GUARDS. ABOUT 4 HRS LATER; IT APPEARED THAT MOST PAX SETTLED DOWN.

THE CABIN CREW WERE IN THE FIRST CLASS PORTION OF THE ACFT. THE DETAINEE BEGAN DEMONSTRATING HOSTILITIES AS SHE SPAT ON THE GUARDS. A FEMALE GUARD RECEIVED A LARGE SECRETION OF BODILY FLUID DIRECTLY IN HER EYE AND REQUIRED IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTN. THIS ACTION CAUSED ADDITIONAL EMOTIONAL DURESS FOR THE CABIN CREW. MANY SUGGESTED NEVER DOING A SIMILAR FLT AGAIN. WE WERE ASKED TO DEPART THE ACFT BY CUSTOMS AND WE DID. IT TOOK ALMOST 30 MINS TO CLR CUSTOMS. WE REMAINED IN THE SAME ARR HALL AS THE DEPORTEES AND THIS MADE FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THE PAX BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE WHO WE WERE. I APCHED THE POLICE OFFICER AND REQUESTED ASSISTANCE BEYOND THE ARPT LOBBY AS PAX BEGAN CLAIMING THEIR PERSONAL LUGGAGE.

IN MY HASTE TO REMOVE THE CREW AND PROVIDE A SWIFT JOURNEY AWAY FROM ANY FURTHER EXPOSURE OF HOSTILITIES; I WAS UNAWARE THAT THE OUTBOUND CREW WAS NOT IN THE DEP HALL. SEVERAL THOUGHTS MUST BE ADDRESSED. FIRST; THERE IS NO DIRECTION AS TO THE STATUS OF THE GUARDS. ARE THEY PAX OR ARE THEY SECURITY TEAMS NECESSARY FOR SAFE PASSAGE? ACCORDING TO THE CABIN CREW; THE GUARDS WERE ATTEMPTING TO SUBDUE UNRULY INDIVIDUALS DURING TAXI. THIS OCCURRED AGAIN DURING TKOF AS THEY PREVENTED OTHERS FROM UNFASTENING SEATBELTS. ONE TEAM FORCEFULLY HELD AN INDIVIDUAL DOWN IN THE AISLE DURING THE CLB PHASE. REGARDLESS OF THE SEATBELT SIGN; OR PHASE OF FLT; THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST DO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN MAINTAINING ORDER. A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BY ME BECAUSE I DEFINED THEIR ROLE AS WORKING INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN PAX; WITH AUTH ABOVE AND BEYOND NORMAL OPERATING POLICY. UPON COMPLETION OF THE FLT; I NEGLECTED TO ADDRESS THAT THEIR DUTY WAS OVERAND A RETURN TO NORMAL OPS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPS MANUAL. THE CABIN CREW WERE IN A STATE OF AWE FROM THIS ORDEAL AND IT WEIGHED HEAVILY ON MY DECISION TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE ACFT; PROVIDING A MORE STABLE AREA TO GATHER THEIR COMPOSURE.

I CONCLUDED THAT IF A PROB WERE TO ARISE THAT REQUIRED THE A FLT ATTENDANT TO TAKE CHARGE OF A SAFETY-RELATED SITUATION; THESE 2 MEN WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH HER COMMANDS; THUS JEOPARDIZING THE SAFETY OF THE REMAINING PAX AND MY CREW. BEFORE I MADE ANY RASH DECISION; I CALLED OUR CHIEF PLT. HE AGREED WITH ME BUT WANTED TO RUN IT BY THE DISPATCH OFFICE AND THE CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR TROUBLESHOOTER. A FEW MINS LATER THE CHIEF PLT CALLED BACK AND RECONFIRMED MY THOUGHTS THAT THIS BEHAVIOR WAS INTERFERENCE WITH FAR DUTIES AND TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE FLT. I ASKED THE 2 GENTLEMEN TO RECONFIRM THAT THEY REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH MY FEMALE CREW MEMBERS' INSTRUCTIONS AND THEY CONFIRMED IT. I THEN ASKED IF THEY WOULD PLEASE LEAVE THE ACFT AND THEY BEGAN TO ARGUE WITH ME. THE 2 MEN NOW WERE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE CAPT'S ORDERS FURTHER ENFORCING MY CONCERN FOR FLT SAFETY. ONLY AFTER THREATENING THEIR PHYSICAL REMOVAL BY THE POLICE DID THEY RELUCTANTLY WALK UP THE AISLE AND OUT OF THE PLANE. I REASSURED THEM THAT OUR CUSTOMER SVC PEOPLE WOULD FIND THEM A FLT WITH ALL MALE FLT CREW MEMBERS SO THEY WOULD NOT BE SO INCONVENIENCED. WHILE FINISHING UP AN MEL ITEM AND PREPARING THE FLT FOR DEP; THE ZZZ CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR CAME RUSHING INTO THE COCKPIT INTERFERING WITH OUR CHKLISTS AND DEMANDED THAT I REBOARD THE 2 MEN IN QUESTION. HE STATED THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO DENY THEM BOARDING AND THAT THE CUSTOMER ADVOCACY REP WAS INSISTING THAT I MUST BOARD THE TWO. I IMMEDIATELY INFORMED OUR CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR THAT I DID INDEED HAVE THE AUTH FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FLT. I IMMEDIATELY PHONED MY CHIEF PLT AND PASSED HIM TO THE INTERFERING CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR. THE CHIEF PLT HAD ME HOLD WHILE HE SPOKE WITH THIS CUSTOMER ADVOCACY PERSON. THE CHIEF PLT AND I BOTH ADMITTED THAT WE DID NOT REALIZE THERE EXISTED SUCH A LOFTY OFFICE AS THIS. AFTER SEVERAL MINS I WAS TOLD BY THE CHIEF PLT THAT I MUST TAKE THESE 2 MEN BECAUSE OF A FEAR THAT THEY WOULD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST COMPANY. I HAD THE 2 MEN BOARDED AND INFORMED THAT IF THEY CAUSED ANY TROUBLE DURING THE FLT I WOULD HAVE THEM ARRESTED UPON ARR. THIS WAS MY ERROR! I JUST TRADED FLT SAFETY FOR CUSTOMER COMFORT; A DIRECT VIOLATION OF FAR PART 91. I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFE OP OF THIS FLT; AND I WAS FORCED TO JEOPARDIZE MY PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES BY MY OWN COMPANY. I SHOULD HAVE HAD MYSELF REMOVED FROM THIS FLT INSTEAD OF TAKING AN UNSAFE SITUATION INTO THE AIR.

THE 2 MEN INFORMED THE OPS AGENT; OPS SUPVR; CUSTOMER SVC SUPVR; AND THE CUSTOMER ADVOCACY DEPT THAT THEY COULD NOT FLY WITH FEMALE FLT ATTENDANTS. THE CHIEF PLT; CSS TROUBLESHOOTER; AND THE CAPT OF THE FLT ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY OF FLT ISSUE AND YET I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO VIOLATED AN FAR.

A few minutes later I was sitting in the center seat talking to the Purser and then the Dispatcher. The passenger in XXA had started being crazy and assaulted one of the Flight Attendants. The 3 of us discussed whether it was a threat level 2 or 3 and were unsure at first. We settled on condition 2. Discussions with Dispatcher centered on best landing site ZZZZ1; ZZZZ2; and finally we decided ZZZZ was just as close with good weather. The Flight Attendants were told to cuff the out-of-control passenger and also to tie his legs with plastic cuffs. Since he was also out of control verbally; I suggested duct taping his mouth; though that ended up not being necessary. Nearby passengers were moved. We declared an emergency and got nearly direct clearance to ZZZZ. Dispatch coordinated our arrival; law enforcement; medical; fuel and cargo. We got an onboard physician to check the individual and ensure that there was nothing seriously wrong with the passenger. The Flight Attendant who was choked by the passenger was also OK. We landed without incident and the passenger was removed by authorities. Lessons learned: Neither the Flight Attendant nor First Officer flight manuals showed the new location of the security kit and handcuffs on the newly configured -400's. It took 10 minutes to find the cuffs. I requested that the Dispatcher keep our Satphone connection open so that as events evolved we could instantly make decisions -- worked great! I also finally got a Flight Attendant to stay on the interphone at the top of the stairs so that I could maintain a running account of events upstairs where the passenger was assigned. We were fortunate to have a doctor on board to make sure the passenger's health was not in jeopardy. Declaring an emergency and making a slight divert to ZZZZ turned out to be a good decision. Supplemental information from ACN 819073: Approximately 5 hours into flight in cruise with Captain in bunk; Aft Purser called to notify us that there was an unruly passenger in seat XXA; the passenger had thrown mini liquor bottles around; was shouting and had grabbed the Flight Attendant after being cut off from alcohol. Other First Officer and I broke out the FOM and determined that this was a level 2 threat. Other First Officer woke Captain up while at the same time we received another call from the Flight Attendants letting us know that the passenger had grabbed him by the throat. At that point we locked down the cockpit and turned on the seatbelt sign; while concurrently notifying Dispatch. Captain then contacted dispatch via Satcom while also keeping a Flight Attendant on the line continuously. Pilot in the left seat stayed the pilot not flying and coordinated with ATC; while I ran the checklists and helped the Captain with communications. Dispatch recommended ZZZZ1 or ZZZZ2 -- both about 1;150 miles away. Flight Attendants called again stating passenger was still shouting; now throwing water; etc. and the Captain made the decision with our concurrence that the passenger was to be handcuffed. He also had the Flight Attendants ask for a doctor to monitor the passenger while handcuffed. Passenger kept yelling and shouting and the decision was made to divert to ZZZZ due to the distance being equal to ZZZZ1 by this time; and the excellent facilities there as well. At this time we declared an emergency with ATC and received clearance to ZZZZ. Passenger remained unruly but no further significant disturbances occurred as 2 Flight Attendants were around him at all times. We landed at ZZZZ without incident and the appropriate authorities met the aircraft and escorted the passenger off. Dispatch had set up all services required and made our stop very efficient. The authorities in ZZZZ were very helpful and efficient as well. Crew coordination was excellent between flight deck members; the Flight Attendants; as well as dispatch.",,,,"A B747 passenger became unruly attacking Cabin Attendants.

I explained that we wanted to have a fun but safe time and advised they were not to touch the burners or red lines at any time. Crew signed agreement and release of liability waivers before we left the house. Once at the balloon launch site; all were encouraged to help unload trailer; discuss parts of the balloon; and help with the set up. Again; I advised them not to touch the burners or red line and stated the reasoning. The balloon was launched safely with pilot and one passenger aboard without incident. Approximately 30 minutes into flight; I discussed the normal landing procedure and stance with the passenger and again advised them not to touch the burners or red line during flight or landing. Approximately 50 minutes into the flight; I spotted a field just beyond a small grove of trees. I advised the passenger we were going to start our descent for landing; to take the proper stance and do not touch the burners or red line. I descended to approximately 50 FT AGL to just brush the top of the tree line. The passenger panicked and pulled the red line. The balloon immediately descended quickly into the middle of the trees and the envelope collapsed. I made a split second decision not to try to reset the top by using the burners as I thought it would cause more damage to the balloon and may result in injury to my passenger or myself. A minor fire started in the dead tree and started melting the envelope. I turned off all the burners and tanks. The basket touched the ground. Once the basket was stable; I told the passenger to exit the basket and move away. I then exited the basket; grabbed the fire extinguishers and put out the fire. 6-8 panels were damaged. No injuries were sustained. Corrective action: I intend to keep the red line in my hand from the time of descent for landing until the balloon has been safely landed and all passengers have exited the basket. Being short on stature; it would be unwise to keep the passengers in front of me; however; I intend to keep the passengers within my range of vision.",,,,"Hot air balloon experienced a hard landing and fire damage when the passenger pulled the red line during the landing approach.",

At the end of boarding; a foreign lady came on board. Agent shut the forward door. The #1 Flight Attendant informed me (#3 Flight Attendant) that the passenger was in seat XXC had been drinking per the agent; but that the agent boarded passenger anyway because passenger promised to be good. I at this point spoke to #1 and said 'why did agent board a passenger that had the appearance of intoxication?' I went to check on the passenger to see what she looked like since we had been warned about her from the agent. When I arrived at seat XXC the passenger was talking animatedly at all involved around her. She stuck her hand out towards the male in seat three rows behind her. The male tried to ignore her but it was unavoidable. I informed the #1 Flight Attendant that it appeared the passenger was really bothering the passengers around her. We started taxiing. The #4 Flight Attendant was walking the aisles when she came to XXC. I was not back there at this point. I was talking to the #1 Flight Attendant. The #4 quickly comes to first class and stated 'the passenger needs to come off.' The #4 says XXC is bothering passengers around her. #1 calls the Captain at her jumpseat and tells him we need to go back to the gate. So; we taxi back to the gate. The gate agent comes on board along with a Manager. The #4 goes to the seat XXC. It takes gate agents and a Supervisor several minutes before the lady gets up out of her seat and begins moving forward towards first class to exit. When the passenger in XXC makes it to first class; she drops/places her bag on the floor of first class and says she doesn't want to get off. The gate agent tells her sternly to get off. The passenger picks up her bag and exits the aircraft. Passenger then turns around after stepping off aircraft and looks at myself the #1 and says 'I hope your plane crashes.' Someone said 'what did you say?' And passenger repeats the statement 'I hope your plane crashes.' She also raises her arms up in the air and jesters towards us. Agent and Supervisor for agents all heard her say this. One of them started saying something to her. Agent then re-closes the door and we went on our merry way. The whole incident should never have made it as far as passenger being boarded. The agent very much knew that the passenger was drunk (had been drinking). The passenger should never have been boarded. There is nothing open at this airport that early in the morning to have a drink of alcohol. Passenger must have been drinking since last night. The agent should have never asked the passenger 'would she be good?' Once the passenger was intoxicated; it doesn't matter is she is going to be good. She's intoxicated and can't be boarded. Also; I noticed that we let this same passenger fly on the same day on another flight. Why? Why would we let a passenger that has already caused an aircraft to go back to the gate to travel on the same day? Why would we let a passenger travel at all the turns around we she is removed and says twice with hands moving 'I hope your plane crashes.' This is such a ridiculous string of events. Passenger should never have been boarded. Don't board intoxicated passengers or passenger that tell flight crew 'I hope your plane crashes.' As a side note; I noticed in the passenger PNR that she is claiming discrimination. That couldn't be further from the truth. She was removed solely because she was intoxicated.",,,,"A Flight Attendant reported that an intoxicated passenger was knowingly boarded by the gate agent with a verbal notice that the passenger would 'behave'.

The flight attendant called the cockpit.  My First Officer answered the call.  He then informed me that two passengers where non-compliant with the Flight Attendants instruction to stow electronic equipment; put their seats up; and stow tray tables.  She requested that I have the police meet the flight at the gate.  I proceeded to land the plane; taxi clear of the active runway; set the brake and coordinate with airport operations and ground control to have the police meet our plane.  The police met the flight and spoke with the passengers.  One of the passengers was male and the other female; both in their early twenties.  The male passenger requested that paramedics look at his back because he thought the flight attendant hurt his back when she put his seat into the upright position.  He said he just wanted his condition documented.  I spoke with the flight attendant and she said she moved the females seat into the upright position and never touched the males seat.  Also; earlier in the flight both passengers had purchased alcohol.  They did not appear to be intoxicated to me when they deplaned.  The flight attendant explained that these passengers had used several curse words to express their non-compliance; the nature of which were degrading and derogatory.  My impression was that both flight attendants were upset and fearful that these passengers would physically harm them.  The police gathered names and information and released the passengers.  Meanwhile I went into the terminal to get food for one of the flight attendants to ensure that these folks would not encounter each other again.  Interestingly I passed these two coming up the stairs and heard the male passenger loudly state; 'she should have been choked.' This lent quite a bit of credence to the palpable fear these flight attendant's felt. I consider these passengers to be a risk to safety of other passengers and the flight crew.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain is informed during approach that two passengers are non compliant with with Flight Attendant instructions to raise seat backs; stow tray tables; and turn off electronic devices.

The Captain replied that it was her decision and that he would 'back her up'. The gate agent showed up and asked to see the passengers.  Agent went back and talked to the passengers and then came up and said that the girls seemed fine to him. He said 'I will remove them if you want; but they seem fine;' then he asked again if she was sure she wanted him to remove the passengers. The Lead then came up to the cockpit and informed us about what was going on and again told us that she 'did not feel comfortable transporting the passengers.' The Captain then said 'I saw the two girls; they look pretty young. How much trouble could they be?' At that point I jumped in and said 'don't let anyone pressure you. If you don't feel comfortable with them traveling with us then stick by your guns.'  The Captain then jumped in and said 'I'm the supervisor here; I will handle this.' The Lead then went back and talked to the Gate Agent. When she returned; she said 'Its fine; we can go' so the captain said 'ok; close it up.' After the door was closed the other Flight Attendant leaned in and said 'the gate should have just removed the passengers.' The captain said 'are you ok with it and the B FA is ok with it?' She said 'ya...ya; we are ok' then closed the door. We pushed back and departed. Upon arrival; after parking brake was set; I told the Captain that I thought he handled the situation in a very unprofessional manner. He walked out of the cockpit. The Lead came in and said that she would be writing an event report because all this took place in front of first class passengers.  Gate agents should do their job and not board passengers that are intoxicated. Once a flight attendant steps up and says the passengers are intoxicated and should not travel; that should be it.

He came up the left side of the plane as Flight Attendant #5 had described it to find me and assault me by throwing his elbow into my back side pushing me a few feet forward. It happened so fast I reacted to Flight Attendant #5; what just happened. They both commented that I was just assaulted. I went to the passenger; who said I stepped on his foot; which I guess must have been protruding under the curtain into business class. I said; 'you cannot just assault a flight crew.' Flight Attendant #1 came over and got the same response from him. The Captain was informed and he radioed ahead for the flight to be met. He told Flight Attendant #1 not to use the passenger misconduct form because he already assaulted me. Anyway the flight was met and he was taken off the plane by various police officers including customs.

In disbelief and startled by the action; that had no reason or prior disturbance or complaint from either the passenger or the Flight Attendant and realize that not only the passenger was not seated in business class but had walked from his seat (which wasn't his seat) to attack Flight Attendant #8. Flight Attendant #8 and I went to where he was sitting and confronted such act. He said that Flight Attendant #8 had stepped on him on purpose as he (Flight Attendant #8) was doing his service in the business class cabin and his foot was under the curtain as he stretched his leg; which he complaint he had a problem and as he (Mr. X) started 'a war on his own.' I decided that no explanation of his would justify the assault; which not only had a prior situation but many facts that aggravated his assault. I right away went to talk to the Captain; which asked to also talk to Flight Attendant #8 and it was decided that we would deal with the authorities and resolve the physical attack on the Flight Attendant upon landing and Local Police since Mr. X didn't continue on the attack and seemed that regretted his action; even though; never expressed that verbally. Insisting on the fact that he had been stepped on purpose and later stated he was kicked on purpose. He crossed all the way to business class from his seat which wasn't his seat to attack Flight Attendant #8 with no prior complaint and simply did what he thought was a 'good lesson' for Flight Attendant #8; who was unaware of any wrong doing was caught by surprise. Mr. X's original seat was XXB which also only made his attack on Flight Attendant #8 worse; his action by no means is justified; he returns to XXB throughout the rest of the flight. I was told he had 4 bottles of wine. I don't know if Flight Attendant #8's back is hurt but calling for authorities upon landing was the only right thing to do; after such an attack. He was taken by Homeland Security and Local Police Department when we landed and since Mr. X was on XXB I thought passengers could deplane and upon Mr. X's approach to the door I would let them know. But I was told that the procedure always is to have all passengers seated and they would enter aircraft and take the passenger. So at that point I made a PA and asked all passengers to please take their seats for a moment which they quickly did as they saw Law Enforcement walking into aircraft. They proceeded to aft aircraft and took Mr. X. and also our statements. All they told me that the situation would be taken by the FBI since it wasn't US jurisdiction; where and when it happened. I didn't use any flex cuffs or force after talking to the attacker since he was very cooperative and didn't seem to be anymore threat thru the flight. Only told main cabin flight attendants to not serve him anymore alcohol and keep an eye on him and upon checking on him throughout the flight he was sleeping. I do not know the outcome after he was taken into custody. Nothing would justify such an attack on a crew member.",,"An international Passenger assaulted a Flight Attendant in flight after the Flight Attendant unknowingly stepped on the Passenger's foot which was behind a curtain in business class where the passenger did not belong because he had a coach seat.",

I asked her why they were on board then and notified the Flight Attendant B and pilots.  Flight Attendant B said the passenger in XXA smelled of alcohol and gave her a hard time about stowing his luggage and his pants were partially down in the back.  As a crew; we decided to have the passenger in XXA removed for his own safety and the Captain and First Officer told the Gate Agent to remove him.  She proceeded to get her Supervisor; and the passenger was removed.  The Captain also made a PA announcement regarding the flight attendant's role in safety and reminded passengers to follow our instructions.  Of course this incident added to our already late departure time due to our previous flight's arrival time and having to change gates clear across the airport.","The Reporter who was Flight Attendant A stated that she did not personally interact with the passenger involved during boarding and so did not know that he was intoxicated. Only after boarding when the Gate Agent notified her about the passenger's condition did she then communicate with Flight Attendant B who reported that the passenger was in fact loud; somewhat combative and smelled of alcohol. The flight attendants decided to ask that the Flight Crew have the passenger removed.

About 5 minutes later the Flight Attendants reported the dog had chewed a hole through its carrier and could not be contained and that the female passenger had no control over her dog. The Flight Attendants said that they did not believe Medlink was necessary for any of the bites and that they had opened the first aid kit to treat the passenger's cut. The bitten passenger made it clear he did not want medical attention.We informed Dispatch of all the above and since we had a biting dog on the loose with no safe place to keep him plus the owner had no control over the dog and refused multiple times to comply with crew instructions to keep the dog in the carrier we told Dispatch we were requesting a diversion into ZZZ1. Dispatch agreed and we informed the Flight Attendants and the passengers of our intentions. The first class passenger who was bitten did not want us to divert and did not want medical attention. To be on the safe side we requested through Dispatch to have the paramedics meet the aircraft plus someone with a pet carrier to contain the dog who was described as a wiener type dog.We made a 142;000 LB/250 FPM overweight landing and when we arrived at the gate the dog was contained in a carrier and probably placed in quarantine. I believe the medics took a look at our passenger. The Flight Attendants bite was just a scratch; so she did not have the paramedics look at her. The Flight Attendants Supervisor wanted her to be checked out before she flew again; but she informed them it was just a scratch and the Supervisor said it was OK to proceed to ZZZ2 and she could get it looked at there. Someone had made the decision to have the female passenger who owned the dog removed from the flight. I'm not sure who that was but that sounded good to me and it was already a done deal by the time I was informed of it.We had Maintenance replace the first aid kit and sign off the overweight landing. We refueled and with new paperwork pushed off the gate. As we were away from the gate we noticed 3 police vehicles one of which was a K9 unit. On the taxi out we were informed by operations that the police had confirmed that the dog was current on all its shots. We passed that information on to the Flight Attendants later in the flight and they also informed the bitten passenger.Later in the flight the Flight Attendants reported to us that many passengers commented that while they were in the boarding area in ZZZ1 they observed the female passenger having great difficulty controlling her dog and even had one report that the dog had bitten the gate agent. I have no idea if this is true or not. The rest of the flight was uneventful and we blocked into the gate in ZZZ one hour and eight minutes late.",,,,"An A319 diverted to a nearby airport for an overweight landing when a passenger's dog escaped from its carrier and bit a Flight Attendant and another passenger.

The Captain and I were both taken off guard by this because we were in sterile cockpit. However; we felt that there may be a safety of flight issue or physical threat to the Flight Attendant. The Captain looked at me to answer to the call. When I answered the Flight Attendant sounded nervous and distressed and said that a passenger was 'being disruptive; arguing with her and is on his phone. He won't turn off his phone even though I made three announcements. Do I have time to go back again and tell him to turn it off?' I said; 'No; we are in the approach phase. Stay seated and we can make an announcement.' After the initial call we were cleared for the approach and had intercepted the localizer. The glide slope started coming down. The Captain called for 'flaps 15' and I put the flaps into position. I informed the Captain of the issue and she said to make a 'loud' announcement that all electronic devices must be turned off. I made an assertive PA. After the PA; the glide slope was still coming down to be intercepted and the Captain called 'gear down'. I put the gear down and did the pilot not flying 'flow'. The Captain called 'Flaps 20 Before Landing Checklist' and I did the respective pilot not flying duties. I asked if we needed to make sure the Flight Attendant was seated and the problem was handled because we were unsure where the passenger was and if he was a physical threat. The Captain said 'yeah; call quickly to make sure' and I used the call button to call the cabin. The Flight Attendant answered and said that the passenger was 'not listening' but did not indicate that anything else was wrong and said he was in his seat. At that time; we stopped all communication with the cabin because we did not feel that there was an immediate threat to the approach or landing the aircraft. We continued the ILS 4R approach and landed without incident. Upon landing and clearing the runway we were instructed to contact Ground. Ground gave us taxi instructions to taxi via 22R; E; to the gate. Then; per standard BOS procedure; I took Comm 2 to contact Operations and get a gate assignment and the Captain monitored Comm 1. The Captain said we should have security meet us to handle the passenger. I agreed and asked Operations to have police meet the aircraft. We completed the after landing checklist; taxied to the gate; and completed the parking checklist. Upon reaching the gate; passengers were deplaned as usual (pending a 5 minute delay while we waited for security); the Captain contacted Operations; and I spoke with the police about the matter. ATC was NOT made aware of what happened because; after our final call to the cabin; we did not feel that there was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft. Upon completing the flight we discussed what should have been done and what actions could have been better. We agreed that we should not have answered the call because the EMER switch (indicative of an emergency) was not used. Therefore; we should have continued the flight and assessed the situation further once we had landed. In the future; I will not answer calls initiated by the cabin during sterile cockpit unless the EMER switch is used to indicate an emergency condition. Answering the call only increases workload during a time of task saturation. I will also ensure that all crew members understand communication requirements and what is expected during sterile cockpit and emergency operations.",,,,"An air carrier First Officer discussed the propriety of a call from a Flight Attendant regarding a disruptive passenger during approach and landing.",

Level at 17;000 FT [with] autopilot on in heading select mode. We planned for FL240 and ATC said FL220 would be our final [altitude]. ATC cleared us to climb from 17;000 FT to FL220. I set FL220 in altitude MCP window and received acknowledgment from the First Officer for FL220. Still dealing with passenger issue in first class; monitoring flight progress; listening to ATC in back ground; while talking to #1 Flight Attendant. First Officer was doing a good job deviating around weather. I did not notice First Officer grab the altitude selector knob instead of heading select knob to try to turn the aircraft further right around weather. He was looking outside as we were between CB cells. He realized the aircraft was not turning and he looked at MCP and saw 241 in altitude window. Realizing what he had done he reset 240 instead of 220 back in altitude window. He had FL240 on the brain because we were filed for FL240. We were both task-saturated at this point dealing with all issues [stated above]. I rejoined First Officer after passenger issue and normal checklist completion and we were approaching FL220. I noticed we didn't get our 900 FT prior illumination on our altimeters and looked at altitude window and saw 24;000 FT displayed. I asked the First Officer if we had been given FL240; he didn't answer. As we climbed through FL220 at approximately 500 FPM; I said to level at 220! The First Officer turned off autopilot and descended from 22;250 FT back to FL220. Turned autopilot back on and we remained at FL220. I asked him why 24;000 FT was in the altitude window. We were so busy we had to put that behind us and complete our mission of flying the aircraft to a safe landing. We broke out of weather about 150 miles from our destination and landed the aircraft uneventfully.

I contacted Maintenance via phone and asked for any input they could offer. The Maintenance Controller suggested to shut off the IFE (in flight entertainment) using the emergency shutoff switch. This was performed by the cabin crew. After approximately 10 minutes; I phoned the Purser and was told the fumes had not dissipated and were now moving aft of the original location. Other sources of possible fumes by operating electronic devices were investigated but could not be located. During this time; we were in contact with Dispatch via ACARS. We were advised of the weather along our route of flight at possible diversion airports. Based on this information; the First Officer and I completed the Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke checklist which advised us to LAND ASAP. Dispatch was contacted and the decision was made to divert.

This caused a significant delay in our departure since LAS was using 25s and 19s. At nearly one hour we had an ECAM for an APU bleed leak; after complying with the ECAM procedures and a short time later we received another ECAM for a Right Wing Pneumatic Leak. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance and determined we needed to return to the gate. Upon reaching the gate Maintenance came on board and; after some trouble shooting; determined that a repair would take some time and some passengers deplaned. After an hour or more went by; we were told a fix may not be coming in the near term. As a result all the remaining passengers departed.Maintenance then indicated that a part they were looking for had been found and that a repair would be made and completed in approximately 40 minutes. During that time the passengers were re-boarded per Customer Services desires and we waited for the paperwork and logbook to be finished. Another hour then passed before I got word that the repair had not been made and that an MEL would be placed on the aircraft for an inoperative Right Pack. I contacted Dispatch and had the release redone accordingly. Now more than an hour had passed since the passengers had been re-boarded.We were finally ready for push back when the ECAM for an APU Bleed Leak returned. We stopped the push back called back the Customer Service Supervisor and Maintenance to make new arrangements and repairs. At this time the passengers were getting very irritated; the cabin was getting warm and information from Maintenance and Customer Service was slow in coming. At that point a passenger angrily gave one of the flight attendants a copy of that days newspaper with an article speaking to a recent court order against our pilots to stop any kind of a work slow down (NOT THE CASE HERE OR EVER). He told the Flight Attendant to give this to the Captain and tell him 'we know what is going on and it's not right'. At which time he proceeded to stir up the passengers around him.With it hot on the aircraft and tempers high; the situation went down hill rapidly. The Flight Attendant gave me the paper and relayed the passenger's remarks as well as the fact that several people were now getting loud and that we were starting to lose control of the cabin. While waiting for Maintenance to give us an idea of what was now going to happen I asked the Flight Attendant to have that passenger come to the cockpit and I would explain the situation to him personally. He refused and told the Flight Attendant that I could come back in the cabin to him. The group of passengers around this one passenger was rapidly turning into a mob. Another passenger then interjected himself into the situation. He was also very loud and using profanity and aggressive behavior towards the flight attendants. I called for a Customer Service Supervisor and a Customer Representative Officer (both the same person in this case). We discussed the situation and my concern that we were losing control of the cabin and a mob was developing. She agreed that the two instigating passengers should be removed from the flight and proceeded to do so. Shortly after that I made an announcement and explained as best I could the nature of the maintenance issue. Several minutes later we were advised that the aircraft was being removed from service and a new aircraft was being sought. Ultimately; the flight was operated more than 8 hours late. At that point I raised some concerns with Crew Scheduling regarding crew duty time and back of the clock operations that this crew had not planned for nor had planned for the rest required for such and operation. I gave a cut off time of 14 hours duty time for the crew before I stopped the operation. Argument ensued from Scheduling indicating that we were REQUIRED TO GO TO 15 HOURS DUTY TIME. I politely indicated againthat 14 would be the end of the line for me. This goal was met; barely. But with a lot of fighting and hand ringing; not once did I feel that Crew Scheduling was concerned for safety; only the completion of the flight at any cost.The causes of events such as this are plain and simple loss of Captain's authority. I had no say as to when the flight was boarded in light of the maintenance issue (and pending court order). My decisions on maintenance issues are now not only being questioned by the company; but also the passengers as a result of the public battle over maintenance write ups; etc. Decisions [are made] by people not on location and unaware of the situation on board the aircraft be it mechanically; environmentally or emotionally; people whose only desire is to 'move the metal'. In addition we now have decisions being questioned by passengers who have absolutely no knowledge what-so-ever of aviation or aircraft systems because of newspaper articles calling into question pilot's decisions.This company needs to restore Captain's authority and provide support for the PIC in times of maintenance difficulty. We need less second guessing; more interest in safety and less emphasis on moving the metal. We need to allow my nearly 27 years of jet experience and almost 23 years as a Captain work for the company as a valuable tool and not just a company expense that they need to control.",,,,"An A321 Captain faced with lengthening maintenance delays; unco-operative ground personnel and short tempered passengers--whose displeasure had been catalyzed by news reports of previous conflicts between labor and management at this airline--had to have two passengers removed and debated with crew schedulers about continuing the flight after a more than eight hour delary.",

We communicated with Maintenance Control and Dispatch our situation. We advised them that we were holding at FL330 present position and working through the procedures. We elected to return to departure airport. We planned on holding at a lower altitude with flaps 2 to burn down below max landing weight. Dispatch did give us the go ahead to land overweight but we thought having only one reverser; no autobrakes; slow flaps; only some spoilers; no nose wheel steering; manually lowering the landing gear; and an FAA guy helping us in the jump seat; that having lots of time; we elected to burn to less than 142 KTS for landing. At this point we received a call from the flight attendants that there was a passenger disturbance in back. An individual claiming to be a reporter would not follow crew member instruction during a declared emergency. This man was attempting to film and interview crew and passengers as the event unfolded and ignored all requests from crew and fellow passengers to sit down and behave. We finally assigned two armed police officers who were traveling with us to baby sit him while the adults handled the in flight emergency. After holding for more than an hour; our weight was below 142 KTS and we made an approach and landing. The landing gear was lowered manually with no event; we had briefed all the items that would pop up when we did this and planned for the extra time. The landing was uneventful and we stopped at the far end of the runway remaining on the runway until we were pulled to the gate. There was much rejoicing and lots of police to meet our; non compliant; passenger.",,,,"A320 crew experienced a GREEN HYD SYS RES LOW passing FL330 and elects to return to departure airport after declaring an emergency and burning down to landing weight.",

Upon applying power to 40 percent for takeoff all indications were normal. Aircraft veered slightly right so I applied left rudder to compensate and continued to add takeoff thrust. Aircraft continued to veer to the right. I applied continuous left rudder to compensate. Once I reached full rudder deflection (approximately 40 KTS); I aborted takeoff. I brought the aircraft to a stop and determined steering via tiller was operational and returned to gate. Once back in the gate Maintenance Control advised me that the Mechanic was on another aircraft so the delay would be unknown. We decided deplaning passengers would be the best option until we received further information.While deplaning a Passenger got very verbally abusive and threatening to myself and a flight attendant. Once all passengers were deplaned I informed the gate that the Passenger in question would not be continuing on our flight. He (Gate Agent) agreed and Gate Agent was enlisted to defuse the situation. Meanwhile the Mechanic was able to complete rudder inspection and determined there were no issues with rudder. The aircraft was signed off 'ops check good' and we were instructed to re board. Although the Mechanic had reservations and did not think the rudder was the root problem; Maintenance Control directed him to sign it off. So he did. While boarding Gate Agent notified me that the Passenger I had denied boarding was asking to apologize in hopes of being permitted to continue on this flight. As I was making my way to the gate this Passenger began to threaten and verbally abuse Gate Agent. At this point she (Passenger) was not permitted to speak with me and law enforcement was called. Law enforcement removed her from the gate. We continued to pushback. The ramp crew reengaged steering on ground service panel and departed. As I called for rudder check I noticed 'steer off' was no longer illuminated on the EICAS as it was prior to push. I then hit my steering disconnect switch and heard a grinding noise and felt vibration in the switch. I then asked the First Officer to try his steering disconnect switch. His did the same thing. We again returned to gate. Maintenance Control was again notified and Mechanic sent out. After much troubleshooting the steering was still inoperative and sporadic. It was finally determined that the microswitch in the tiller was inoperative and therefore steering did not disengage when tiller released for takeoff. Therefore we encountered a steering runaway situation on the takeoff roll with neither disconnect switch operational. Flight was subsequently cancelled and we were advised of a show time the next afternoon. More thorough inspection of problem by Maintenance on initial return to gate would have prevented the second return.",,,,"EMB170 crew experienced difficulty steering during the initial portion of the takeoff roll; subsequently rejecting the takeoff.

It was not an ECAM exception/immediate action so I completed the ECAM actions listed; and then followed up with the QRH/Supplemental books. I declared an emergency with ATC. I was then sending an ACARS message to Dispatch/Maintenance Control to advise them of the situation. I also notified the flight attendants and explained the situation. [About ten minutes later] we had an ECAM 'SMOKE LAVATORY SMOKE' warning. I called the 1st Flight Attendant and told her the situation. She stated that a passenger had entered an aft lavatory and used a 'fake' cigarette (the kind some people use I assume to help stop smoking). The vapor from this cigarette caused the smoke alarm to activate. During the descent; I kept the flight attendants and passengers informed. I told them we had a hydraulic problem and we would be returning to [departure airport]. I also said we would be configuring earlier than normal and that when the landing gear went down there would be more noise/rumbling than normal because the gear doors would still be open. We would land and stop on the runway and wait to be towed to the gate because I had no nose wheel steering. I told the flight attendants to prepare for a precautionary landing. On the downwind leg we started to configure flaps (which moved much slower than normal). On base leg we manually extended the landing gear and were fully configured before final fix. I expected a normal landing and did not use a 'BRACE' signal. We configured early in case a further problem developed. In that case we would go-around and go to plan B. After landing we came to a full stop. I made an announcement to the passengers; started the APU; and shut down the engines. A few minutes later; Maintenance arrived with a tug.

Prior to being on the charted portion of this RNAV STAR we were given a crossing clearance that was not possible to insert into the legs page of the FMC due to mileage and FMC limitations. I put the crossing fix on the fix page of the FMC; and inserted a circle at the correct crossing mileage. I started down using FLCH to make the crossing. We were then cleared direct to a fix on the arrival; DRRON I believe; and then cleared to descend via the FRDMM1 ARRIVAL. So we had to rush to get down and then get back in VNAV. Twice I had to take the airplane out of VNAV; and once I had to disconnect the autopilot to make all the speed and altitude constraints. We did not have an overly strong tailwind; yet I had to work very hard to comply with this arrival. We had several distractions on or just prior to the arrival including the First Officer finishing his crew meal close to top of descent. We also had an irate passenger that was using foul language that was concerning our flight attendants which I was discussing with them [to evaluate what level of concern and response was appropriate]. This was a major distraction during our descent. An additional distraction was a strong winter storm and turbulence in the descent. We don't believe we missed any crossing altitudes or speeds; but the reason I chose to write this safety report is simple. I believe the FRDMM1 RNAV ARRIVAL is unsafe. If ATC would let us fly it as charted without interference; and there were no other issues it might not be; but I was near the limit of my abilities trying to comply with the charted speeds and altitudes; and again I had to disconnect VNAV and the autopilot to comply several restrictions.

This was the first time we had heard anything about it. Apparently a passenger had taken a picture or video of a piece of tape on a passenger oxygen panel and posted it online with a message stating something to the effect of 'I hope I don't need oxygen'. There were no MEL's on the maintenance log or the flight release. If there had been; the seat row would have been blocked. The First Officer and I went through all logbooks on the flight deck and found no write ups for anything to do with the passenger oxygen system. Apparently; Maintenance did not put the tape there. Concerns: Why were the flight attendants not notified by this passenger about the tape if he was concerned about it enough to take a picture and post it to the Internet? How did this passenger know that this was an oxygen panel? It is not labeled as such. The tape used had an FAA stamp on it. According to second or third hand information; the picture was posted to a Facebook account and forwarded to some friends; one of which happened to be the Vice President of Maintenance. Maintenance personnel removed the tape; placed an MEL on the system and blocked that row just to be safe. We continued the next series of flights. Is possible to track the person down by their Internet posting; or by checking the passenger manifest and checking for airline experience?

She stated that they flew often with their dog and knew what to do. Cabin pet continued to be in unzipped carrier. Customer Service was called and the couple heard him out; but was still out of compliance. A Manager was called to speak to the passenger in the row ahead because he was believed to be under the influence of alcohol. After this brief; it was determined that he was safe for transport; but the couple behind still did not stow their dog under the seat. At this point I asked that the Captain have them removed. Consequently; they were very angry. I believe that the gentleman was under the influence of alcohol; as well as the passenger in front and nearby. The passenger nearby made lunging gestures while he screamed at me on takeoff roll. He was lunging at me with his pillow while his wife tried to calm him. I would say that he was impaired by alcohol and he was part of the party who was removed for failure to stow their cabin pet. I felt very threatened by the passenger. The C Flight Attendant took over my first class duties. I traded jump seats with the B Flight Attendant for landing. We did not issue passenger misconduct because the passenger was so volatile and we feared pushing him further. I performed the C Flight Attendant duties for the flight. The Flight Attendant who took over for me advised me to stay clear of the forward cabin. I felt that the tone of the First Class Cabin was extremely hostile because many were friends with the couple who were removed. I felt sick and fearful for the flight after the passenger threatened me. I considered hiding in the lavatory should he come after me. He spent part of the flight at in the aisle at over wing conversing with his sister. When she heard that there had been a problem she asked if he had been drinking. The Flight Attendant who took over in First Class said that he later apologized to her and that he changed considerably. I tried to maintain calm and professionalism; but I could not stop shaking or calm my stomach the duration of the flight. I am afraid to leave my hotel room for fear that someone should be waiting for me downstairs. I know that this is somewhat irrational; but I am fearful and panicked after this incident. I was nervous exiting the airport and passing our passengers at baggage claim. A man waiting at the bottom of the escalator told me that he was in [the group] and 'not to worry;' as I was just doing my job. We also encountered clear air turbulence on final (I secured myself on the floor at Row 6 and a bird strike on final approach.)One problem is that we offer a pre-departure beverage (alcohol) when we have not had the chance to evaluate passengers seated in first class. It is often not until you have served a pre-departure cocktail that you have had enough interaction to question signs of intoxication. On this flight I served a glass of wine to [the threatening passenger]; a beer to [the passenger first suspected to be under the influence] and a gin and tonic to [another in the party]; whom was in the lavatory for part of boarding I believe. The situation and passengers seemed controlled when these beverages were offered. Not knowing what they had had to drink prior to boarding; there was no frame of reference for alcohol serving guidelines. After the events with [two of the party members]; I suspect that the pre-departure beverage contributed to the problems we had with these passengers.",,,,"After having a threatening; non-conforming passenger removed; the A Flight Attendant assumed the aft C Flight Attendant duties because she felt threatened by other members of removed passenger's party.",

She was restrained and handcuffed then reseated in the back of the aircraft adjacent an off duty Law Enforcement Officer for the remainder of the flight. During the altercation as it was continuing to escalate; the Captain and I had to make a command decision as to whether we should land or continue. Based upon how much the security situation escalated (now a Level 2) and screaming and kicking along the cockpit door; we decided to initiate a 180 turn back to nearest suitable international airport. The Captain delegated PF and ATC duties to me and he dedicated his attention to the cabin and to Dispatch (via Commercial Radio and ACARS). I obtained an ATC clearance (no special handling requested) to begin a turn toward the international divert airport (no descent requested; just clearance to get turned around). The Captain did the best he could to obtain real-time situation updates from the cabin. Nearing what would be top of descent we reconvened pilot communications between ourselves--I gave him an aircraft position/clearance update and he updated me with what was happening in back. The next decision we faced after assessing the real-time situation in the cabin was to determine our next destination. We considered many possibilities all with pro's and con's. Having not yet hit the Equal Time Point; our filed destination was clearly the farthest option requiring on-going monitoring and restraint of the passenger for an additional 3.5 hours. If we did the extreme opposite and landed directly below us we would have had to declare an emergency as we were still thousands of pounds over landing weight. But the nearby international airport was a solid option for Security Level 3 or 4. Being at Level 2 we decided best option was ZZZZ. Our departure airport was 2 hours flight time; we could get normal traffic handling; known law enforcement outcome; passenger accommodation handling and potential crew (re)staffing. These were all unknowns when considering landing at a third country being thrown into the mix. Dispatch pressed us to conduct another 180 degree turn and continue to our filed destination. We declined. Dispatch asked us to consider the nearby international airport and we declined unless he wanted us to declare an emergency (overweight). He then pressed us to get refueled in a second enroute airport; so we could continue to our filed destination. I calculated fuel from to the second airport and we had just enough fuel to get there with minimal reserves; however; the weather was unsatisfactory if we were to plan minimum FOD. While the second divert airport certainly would have worked as an adequate fuel stop; this proposal by Dispatch was not addressing the matter at hand: we needed to get this passenger off the aircraft. We did not have confidence in arriving at a third international destination; having authorities take the woman (if they were willing to take her) and to find out one of the 6 crewmembers could not continue to the filed destination for duty time or emotional reasons. Then we would have 124 passengers and crew clear customs in a foreign airport with an aircraft and crew out-of-position clearing customs in a country that potentially may not take certain passengers (just like Canada refuses entry for people with a DUI on their record; as an example.) The second divert option proposed by Dispatch exclusively centered on fuel matters; not based on security; customs; or duty considerations. Alas; Captain and I decidedly made commitment to return to the departure airport and communicated this to Dispatch; passengers and crew. We received direct clearances but did not request any special handling in order to achieve this direct routing. We were met at the gate by law enforcement and had no further issues with the disruptive passenger; nor her husband (who was also on the flight but didnot disrupt the flight himself) nor any problems with all the inconveniences passengers who also potentially could have started problems because of the ordeal they tolerated through the night just to end up back in at the departure airport.",,,,"B737 flight crew enroute to a foreign destination; decided to return to their departure airport due to an unruly aggressive passenger who had to be restrained and handcuffed.",

Having done several charters over the years; this was the first time I had had this happen. Only one other Flight Attendant and I had ever done charters; all the others were reserves. The experienced [Flight] Attendant had worked a football charter for the same team recently and said that the coaches and Athletic Department VIPs would have alcohol available on board. I have done several football charters but no other school had alcohol on them. She also said to 'expect' that the coaches would gather in the back galley and drink for the entire flight--which they did. They NEVER left the aft galley regardless of the services we were trying to do. One of the coaches wanted to plug his phone into our outlet and was told by one of the Flight Attendant's that the voltage could 'fry' his phone. He then went into the Lav and plugged it into the outlet there. I told him I would have to unplug it before takeoff. He then asked for the first of three mixed vodka drinks he would have before takeoff. In First Class the Charter Coordinator gave us a 5 minute briefing which included telling us he had purchased a half gallon bottle of expensive vodka for the Athletic Director's wife and whatever she didn't drink she was allowed to take home with her. There was very little information about the service itself to be done. The coordinator was not flying the charter with us; but advised another individual would be acting as our Charter Coordinator. When it became clear that the Coach in question was going to ask for more alcohol; I asked the experienced [Flight] Attendant if there were any limits on alcohol consumption on this flight for the coaches. She didn't know and said to ask the temporary Charter Coordinator; which I did. All the conversations were held very quietly in a galley away from the group as I didn't know if--being a charter--the rules regarding alcohol were significantly different from other mainline flights. I got no specific answer other than to be told who the security person was and what I can only describe as a personnel director. What I did NOT know was that the replacement Charter Coordinator had informed the coaches of my question and all of a sudden the coaches' attitudes towards me changed like a haboob descending. I was then treated as a pariah. The Security Director was in the galley for the whole flight as well and asked the attendants who was receiving any alcoholic drink which was being delivered into the cabin. This was; clearly; so that no alcohol was being served to a player. The five coaches in the aft galley drank 2 cases of beer between them and hard liquor as well. The Coach about whom I had spoken to the replacement Coordinator had a minimum of 9 beers/ and or cocktails in the course of the flight and those were only the ones I knew about. Several coaches asked for booze to go as well. Please let me know whatever information your department has that is pertinent to this situation. We realize that many rules are slackened for charters but; in speaking with the replacement Coordinator after the fact on our way back; he said that in nine years of doing college football charters the question had never come up. He then compared the trips to a NASCAR charter where they got so drunk that one of the people threw up on a flight attendant's shoes. I asked him who he thought would be responsible if the fellow who drank all those drinks got in an accident after our service and he said that the responsibility would be the college's and not us (Air Carrier) for having served him.

He kicked a hole in the fuselage [sidewall]. Passengers jumped in when they heard the flight attendant ask for help. This man was German; and I yelled at him in German 'Don't do that!'. He was given water; but refused (violently). He got out of the flex cuffs and I used mine; which didn't work (these are the new ones). They also used restraint tape; but he also got out of that.

The Captain made the decision to discontinue taxing and park the aircraft and wait for Maintenance to arrive. An announcement was made by the Captain that the tire would need to be changed and it would be at least an additional 30 minute delay. The A Flight Attendant spoke with Captain and confirmed the information given over the PA. Flight Attendant A conferred with the remaining Flight Attendant crew B; C; and D that we needed to perform a water service due to the extended delay. A PA was made by the A Flight Attendant explaining the crew would be offering water. At this time the passenger in First Class exited from the lavatory requesting a rum and Coke. An apology was given and it was explained to him that we were only offering water. He became upset and questioned the A Flight Attendant. Flight Attendant D also explained we were on the tarmac and would not be serving alcohol. The passenger had consumed 4 alcoholic beverages in flight possibly 5 because it was believed he consumed his traveling companions' beverage. This does not include pre-departure service. (The passenger did not display signs of intoxication during the flight). He repeatedly kept asking about the delay and at one point was on his cell phone at the 1L door and A Flight Attendant overheard him say 'the Flight Attendant is lying' and he had used some derogatory language. Just as the A Flight Attendant was about to ask him to take his seat he sat down. He then proceeded to ask about the delay again. That's when I; the A Flight Attendant said I would see what was going on. I allowed the passenger to fluster me and take me away from policy and procedures and I opened the door to verify Maintenance fixing the problem [the emergency escape slide deployed].

I stood up and knocked on the door and told the passenger to take her seat we were landing. She said she had to pee and she could 'do what ever she wanted.' I knocked again on the door and asked her if she was smoking in there because I could smell smoke and the smoke alarm was going off so she needed to get out right now! She said that I could not tell her what to do! The cockpit called back to inform us they had a light that said smoke in the lav and we informed him that we had a passenger that refused to go back to her seat. The landing gear was coming down and at this point I told her she better stay in there (if she came out she couldn't get to her seat without endangering the passenger in XXC) The Captain made a PA for the passenger in the lav to return to her seat immediately! She came out; cussing up a storm; and had sprayed something in the lav that she claimed was feminine hygiene spray. I repeated 'were you smoking in there?' She started waving her arms and saying 'she could do whatever the [explitive] she wanted and no one could [explitive] tell her what to do' over and over.Another Flight Attendant got her to sit down with the assistance of the passenger in XXC. I talked to the cockpit and informed them that she was now seated and her seat number. The Captain asked me to check the lav to make sure nothing was on fire and I did.

There was no reason for her to spray that spray and be so defiant if she wasn't guilty! I smell cigarettes and the smoke alarm was going off. I did not smell her spray until she opened the door! She was 2 steps away from the lav the entire flight and she chose to go to the bathroom after we were seated! Police met the flight and questioned her and never came in to check the lav. This woman interfered with the duties of the flight crew; caused alarms to go off in the cockpit during sterile cockpit; told us we couldn't tell her what the [explitive] to do; and almost caused us to land standing up. She should not be allowed to fly again if she can't follow instructions and is going to carry on the way she did! Unfortunately; I believe the police let her go.

We had 10 passengers and no flight attendant. Our Flight Attendant flew the prior passenger leg with us and offered to extend in order to cover the next passenger leg. Her request was denied by scheduling and she was sent home. This was a FAR 135 trip. I conducted the passenger briefing in accordance with the fleet memo. I also received an email telling me to turn off the galley power prior to the flight. Doing so shuts off all power to the convection oven; hot cup; coffee makers and lavatory faucet; but does NOT disable the microwave. To disable the microwave requires pulling its circuit breaker located in the baggage area. In the interest of safety I elected to pull that breaker even though our company does not have a procedure for doing so without a maintenance write-up. At the end of the flight I discovered that the passenger had served themselves alcohol from the galley; which is illegal under FAR 135. I also have serious safety concerns regarding the use of the crystal glasses and stemware as well as the china. We carry a full set of silverware to include chef's knives that could very easily hurt someone. We were unable to ensure that we had a secured cabin prior to landing on this short and crowded flight. Until there is an approved procedure for disabling the microwave oven and securing the breakable china and crystal as well as the silverware and alcohol; we should no longer conduct passenger flights in this fleet without a flight attendant on board for obvious safety and legal concerns. This puts the pilots in a potentially dangerous situation and also puts our airman certificates at risk; not to mention exposing the company to potential risk. Since these flights are being conducted with increasing frequency I have decided to refuse any future passenger leg without a flight attendant as I have serious concerns for my safety and my airman certificate.",,,,"G-IV Captain reports flying ten passengers under FAR 135 without a flight attendant on board.

Working with the aft cabin crew and the Purser; 2 passengers were moved to others seats away from this passenger; as this irritated passenger was apparently under the influence of one or more medications and/or alcohol. There was no change to his condition; attitude; and no escalation of the issue for the next 30 minutes. I was randomly updated by the entire cabin crew with any new issues regarding this passenger throughout the remainder of the flight. I also contacted destination operations to see if the CSR there could offer anything at deplaning to these two accommodating passengers; who had changed seats voluntarily because of this passenger; such as certificates/coupons. We have always had such items for inconvenienced passengers. Goodwill. Great service. I was told any such goodies for Good Samaritan passengers to say thank you has been discontinued. Brilliant. All was well until top of descent. I then understood that this passenger had walked to the aft galley; was unpleasant; rude; threatening; and had locked himself in the lavatory and would not return to his seat for landing. The cabin crew alerted 2 ABP for assistance and the restraint devices were retrieved. A Threat Level One was on deck; and I notified Dispatch to alert law enforcement to respond and be prepared to board the aircraft on arrival. Cockpit was in lockdown. I was in constant contact with the cabin crew and Dispatch as we prepared for landing and LEO intervention was requested. At approximately 12;000 FT; the passenger left the lavatory but would not return to his seat. I made another PA announcement and he was coerced to return to his seat by the cabin crew. This individual was about 6'1'; 250 LBS; 35 years old and strong. Fearing that this unstable and now visibly threatening passenger would be a danger to my crew and deplaning passengers; I instructed the Purser to advise the folks to remain seated upon arrival and stay seated until otherwise instructed. I met the LEO's at L1 upon block in and quickly informed them of the situation and told them to remove this passenger from my aircraft. The 2 Police Officers proceeded to where this passenger was seated. The First Officer; Purser and I were at the cockpit entrance. Suddenly the passenger stood up and was aggressive towards the 2 LEO's. The struggling passenger was then dragged off the aircraft into the jetway where the LEO's attempted to restrain him with handcuffs. The First Officer; Purser and I remained at the door L1. I did not want this fight to return to the aircraft and the passengers were reassured that the jetway would be cleared shortly for their deplaning. I discussed this with the First Officer and Purser. It was too dangerous for any passengers to be going thru the jetway due to the police action 5 feet from the aircraft door. Then the extremely angered passenger pirouetted throwing the 2 LEO's off their balance and they all fell to the floor. The 2 LEO's pounced on him; still unable to restrain him completely. Then I saw the passenger's left arm slide out from under him on the floor by the jetway weather doors and was very close to one LEO's weapon belt. This Officer was struggling with the right arm and shoulder. The other Officer was trying to restrain the upper torso and head. I was concerned about the pending threat to my crew and passengers and the chance that this arrest might suddenly be going the wrong direction. I joined the fracas on the jetway floor and grabbed hold of the perpetrator's left forearm and elbow. I used what I felt was justified force in restraining the left arm and bending it backwards to his center back where one LEO grabbed it and totally restrained this violent person. One of the LEO's was cut on his arm/hand. No injuries to any crew or passengers. A police unit arrived and removed this individual. I thanked the folks for their patience and all passengers deplaned normally.

It's hard to visualize what's happening in the back and the two females [flight attendants] and lead wanted to divert and take this person off the plane. In order to divert and what they don't understand is they had no clue where we were and how much fuel we had.I asked for male flight attendant and asked him what was happening and he said the guy was just drunk and talking junk.

When we got off plane and went to the hotel; I talked to a PAX that was on our plane and sitting in front of deportee. ...we talked for several minutes about what happened and he confirmed what I thought.  He told me that the male FA and a female PAX from Canada would get [deportee] calmed down; and as soon as he was calm [one of the female flight attendants] would tell him to be quiet; and if the female PAX (that was calming [the deportee]) doesn't get back to her seat; that she would be locked up as well. [PAX added that] when a person is drunk like this and an FA gets verbal with a drunk PAX; it starts all over again.I told the lead and both female FA to stay away from this drunk person and let [the male FA] calm him down.  Also; this deportee never hit anyone he was just verbal. This went on for several minutes and we finally diverted to [a convenient airport] where both deportees were removed.

While completing our safety checks for landing; I noticed that Mr. X did not have his seatbelt fastened. I again asked Mr. X to buckle up for landing. He was not complying; so I assisted Mr. X by buckling his seatbelt for him. I proceeded to my jumpseat and buckled in. While seated I had heard the noises of a seatbelt being unbuckled. I turned around and looked up the aisle toward the forward part of the aircraft and noticed that Mr. X had his seatbelt unbuckled and hanging in the aisle. I proceeded to get up and inform Mr. X that his seatbelt need to be fastened for landing. He made some unrecognizable noises and words and proceeded to stand up and enter the aisle of the aircraft. I advised Mr. X that he needed to seated for landing. There was a lady passenger seated in front of him in XYD that had an infant attached to her in a Baby Bjorn type of harness. Mr. X proceeded to attempt to grab the child by placing his hands under each of the infants' arms. The pax in XYD was in complete shock. I tried to get Mr. X to release the child. Once I did so; Mr. X continued to stay in the aisle of the aircraft when I heard the landing gear deploy. Once again; I asked Mr. X to take his seat for landing and he continued to stand in the aisle. The following happened in order: Mr. X refused to listen to our orders to sit down in his seat for landing.Mr. X became slightly combative with the female passenger seated in XXC who was trying to help. Mr. X grabbed her right wrist tightly causing discomfort and pain. Once FA in the back and I realized how close we were to the ground due to fog; we had to stay standing in the aisle to protect Mr. X. I proceeded to try and get around Mr. X to make sure I was standing in front of him to protect him from lurching forward once we touched down on the runway. FA stayed [in] the back to make sure Mr. X did not fall backwards. While going around Mr. X; he pushed his backside against me and pushed me into the passenger seated at XYC. He then yelled at me telling me I was an '[expletive]' I repeatedly told Mr. X that 'I am here for your safety!!

About 30 minutes prior to landing; the Flight Attendant informed us that the person's assistant told her that the individual did not want to be awoken for landing; and that 'He always sleeps right through landing; no one ever makes him get up.' It was getting bumpy; so the PIC told the Flight Attendant (FA) to inform him that the Captain was instructing him for his own safety to comply with Federal laws and fasten his seat-belt.At that point; the assistant came forward and repeated the statement that 'He always flies with him and has never had to wake this person up prior to landing.'

Since we were in the sterile cockpit environment; and the situation looked like it could escalate into a confrontation; we decided the safest course of action was for us to simply land and get these people off the plane rather than attempting to force the passenger to comply while we were so close to the airport. In addition; the company induced fear of making an owner mad; and this individual's known volatile history were factors in our decision to not confront the owner.The company needs to set the expectation with the owner that he needs to be up and in a seat prior to landing; and that if he again fails to comply with crew member instructions that there could be consequences.

He then crosses his right leg over his left knee and then had his foot completely out in the middle of the aisle so that I was unable to get to galley. I then stated 'Sir can I ask you to please move your foot so that I am able to pass by.' The passenger then forcefully grabbed my arm and yanked me down so that my face was directly in front of his and stated 'tell your engineer to build a plane with leg room.' I then turned around and walked into the galley and I did not respond to the passenger at all. He seemed to be extremely tired and was acting in an aggressive manner and refused to move his feet out of the aisle. I then called the Captain to let him know what happened. I then walked to the back of the cabin to tell the number 2 Flight Attendant to be careful when she brought the cart back to the galley because this passenger refused to move his feet and I did not want her to bump him with the cart to upset him further. As she passed next to him to bring the cart into the galley she woke him up and asked him to move his feet because she could not get by. He still did not move his feet and when she attempted to move the cart past his feet she bumped into his foot and a wine bottle fell off the cart and landed on the floor. The number 2 Flight Attendant was standing in front of me and the passenger picked up the wine bottle and threw it at her. She was very startled and asked him what he was doing. When he threw the bottle she backed into the cart and it fell over and hit the service door causing damage to the door. There was a metal piece that was bent and scraped. The Captain then called and asked if we were ok because he heard the cart fall over. I told him what happened and he arranged for the police to meet the flight.

Flight Attendant (FA) retrieves the bag and rampers put it in the forward cargo. Once on the ground in ZZZ2 and parked at the gate; a ramper opens the forward cargo compartment and discovers this bag is smoking. First Officer (FO) went outside to walk around and the lead supervisor informs him of the smoking bag and tells him that he removed the bag from the aircraft. The lead supervisor placed the bag 15 feet away from the airplane on the ground. FO immediately came up the jet bridge and notified me of the smoking bag. I told him to call the fire department and police; he said the lead supervisor has already notified operations and they are on the way. Then I evacuated the aircraft and the jet bridge. I also shut down the airplane. Once in the terminal; the owners of the bag informed me in front of several other people that the bag contains five lithium batteries and film equipment including monitors. The bag catches on fire; and four to five brave rampers try to put the fire out. The flames snuff out for a few minutes and start burning again. It caught on fire three times before the fire department showed up. Which I estimate was at least 30 minutes.  Then multiple fire departments show up including one from outside the airport. They use the proper extinguisher; but by this time not much is left of the bag and it had burned to the ground. Then I went down to the scene to speak with the fire departments; airport security; operations manager and eventually the Police Department. I tried to figure out where the breakdown of communication was because the response time was unacceptable. I also was concerned if those passengers were continuing on to another flight and if they had other bags with lithium batteries that needed to be confiscated. That's why I had the police involved; but the passengers were gone from the gate when [police] showed up; which was approximately 45 minutes and unacceptable. I also called regional chief.Preventative Actions: I am concerned as to why TSA in ZZZ1 did not find the 5 lithium batteries? That error put all our lives at risk. Airport security and the ZZZ2 Police Department decided to not involve TSA immediately but I think they absolutely should have been involved and should be held responsible. I was told by the passengers who owned the bag that they have been traveling with this same bag and film equipment for 7 years. One passenger/owner of the bag claimed to be an engineer and I assume must know the danger of lithium batteries packed together. If that is true; then that is very alarming and I think they should be fined. They knowingly put all our lives at risk by intentionally packing several lithium batteries together. We were very lucky that [it] is a short flight; if the flight was another 15 minutes long; we would have been on fire in flight possibly with smoke and fumes in the cabin and flight deck. I am very glad I said my prayers that morning. I am grateful my crew and the ground crew worked great as a team. The lead supervisor should be specifically recognized for saving the aircraft from fire damage and a potential big disaster considering the fire department at a busy international airport was missing in action.",,,,"While bags were being offloaded at the destination airport ramp personnel noticed smoke emanating from a bag. The bag; which contained 5 Lithium batteries and other electronic devices; subsequently caught fire on the ramp and was successfully extinguished after several attempts.

Purser went back to speak to passenger. Sometime after their conversation he walked towards aft bathroom and I was a few rows behind him. He turned around and said to me 'I am going to smoke in the bathroom again.' He smelled [of] alcohol and appeared slightly drunk. He was not slurring but he had a strange look in his eyes. I told him smoking was prohibited on the aircraft. He waved his butane lighter and opened pack of cigarettes at me and said 'I don't care I'm going to smoke.' Purser grabbed the lighter and cigs out of his hand and went forward. He then told me 'I don't care I have more.' [Purser] was in constant communication with the Captain and handled the situation very professionally. Surrounding passengers said this man was pushing and shoving other passengers in the jetway during boarding. We were keeping an eye on his behavior and he was doing some perverted thing with his tongue. Sticking it out of his mouth and snaking it disgustingly. At some point later purser went to passenger to explain the seriousness of his smoking and he shoved her hard twice. She came and told me this upfront. She called Captain with this information. Then Captain advised crew we were diverting and getting passenger off plane. Unfortunately this passenger presented clear danger to passengers and crew with his defiance of no smoking rule; shoving the purser twice; and not willing to follow any instruction from the crew.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported diverting to remove an unruly passenger.",

Mr. X came to back galley to ask for water to take medication. He was wearing sunglasses and a hat therefore I could not see his eyes. I gave him a cup of water and he went to sit down. We takeoff and start beverage service. They are the first to order as they are in the very back. He orders two wines each for them; but he orders two red and two white. We did not think this was unreasonable as this is a four hour flight. We give him the wines; then he says oh could we just have all white. Fine we say and I have to make a note for inventory purposes. At this point I think they are both a little off but maybe they are just weird. As I have to walk back to galley to get something for another passenger I noticed him take something out of his backpack and pop it into his mouth. On our way back to galley F/A (Flight Attendant) B notices a can on their tray table and asks what it is. He tells her it's beer and then she informs him that is not allowed per regulations.Flight continues and he has his face in her lap with a blanket over him. Both F/A A and B tell him to sit up. Ms. Y; the female whose lap he is in says we are just resting. But then takes a few minutes to get adjusted with her clothing. At this point we all agree they will get no more to drinks from us. Then while I am passing out immigration forms he says can I ask a question? Sure I say; he says can I get another wine I wanted to propose to my girlfriend and put the ring in it. I looked straight at him and said no. They continue to act very odd as though they are either extremely drunk of on some medication or both. Very antsy; dropping things that type of behavior. Then she goes to the lavatory in the back AC left. She locks herself in and I wait about five minutes while she keeps trying to open the door. When she does I am right there and the smell of smoke is unmistakable. I immediately ask for her name and call her to me. I then get gloves to prepare to go through the trash. I ask her where she put the cigarette. I had to ask her 3 times before she says in the toilet. I then tell her it's a federal law that you cannot smoke in an airplane and instruct her to get her passport and sit down. He then approaches me to ask if I couldn't just forget it happened. I again had to tell him No. He continued to ask if I had a heart at all. My response was I do have a heart for all the passengers on board this AC that her ignorant actions could have killed by causing a fire on board; mine included. I took her passport and green card and had the lead hold them. So at this point authorities were to be called as their behavior was clearly escalating and who knew what was going to happen next. For the remainder of the flight Mr. X took video and pictures of us without consent. I repeatedly requested that he delete them and he actively refused. A Sheriff and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) came on board and put them in the back galley to question them. They were both very slow to move and non-compliant at first. But they soon changed their tunes and started to just lie about everything. Of course the authorities couldn't really do anything unless they found something else on them.

I reached 10F and noted a woman with her seat back. Her tray table was down and her back pack was behind her legs. I asked that she bring her seat forward and she did not react. She had her head forward; pressed against the seat in front and scrolling on her PED with ear buds in her ears. I repeated my request a bit louder; but still; there was no reply. The man seated next to her was asleep; also with headphones on and also seemed to not hear me. Unable to reach the woman; I again requested that she prepare for landing; louder still; but again; there was no response from her. Finally; the man behind her jostled her seat and she looked up at me a bit startled. I again asked that she prepare for landing but she had to remove her ear buds. For the 5th time; I asked this young lady to stow her bag; raise her tray table and return her seat to the upright position. Still; the man next to her remained silent with his eyes closed. With more seats to check; I found 22A was unable to hear my request that his laptop be turned off and stowed and his tray table returned. I saw that row 26 had their blue light indicating an electronic device was still plugged in. I asked them to unplug their device; but the man in 26E couldn't hear me and I had to wait for him to remove his headphones for him to hear me ask again that he unplug his PED. Upon returning to the first class area to take my seat; I also had to ask twice of 8B and 9E to unplug items from the outlets; as required by the FAA.These are again examples of why the use of PEDs should not be allowed for approach and landing. Passengers are unaware of our efforts to provide a safe environment and our being in the aisles longer to seek compliance puts us at risk of injury; or worse; if it gets overlooked by flight attendants; puts passengers at risk of injury or not making a safe evacuation in the event of an emergency.We pride ourselves on situational awareness to be prepared for an emergency and expect our passengers to be able to hear commands and requests for complying with FAA requirements that seats be upright; bags stowed; seat belts fastened and tray tables returned; yet we are not able to do this efficiently because passengers are not situationally aware of their surroundings. Other passengers get frustrated; such as the man shaking her seat and pressing it forward before she was ready to bring it upright. Sometimes; we are not able to go down the aisles in situations where there is turbulence and we ask our passengers to comply over the PA.

The child was sitting on the woman's lap in seat 10A. After the beverage service we looked over the paperwork and there was only supposed to be one lap child in 16D; which was the only one we had accounted for during weight and balance. The B-FA and I approached the father of the family who was sitting in seat 9C; since the woman in 10A didn't speak English for us to ask her about the child. During the weight and balance and final compliance check before take-off we had not seen the lap child at all in seat 10A. The woman with the lap child was Middle Eastern and had a burkha and a lot of dressing covering the lap child under her burkha; therefore; we decided that the child was hidden during this time and that's why we didn't catch it.Further into our investigation we asked the father in seat 9C how old the child was. He told the B-FA and myself that the child was 3. We asked the father why the child wasn't in their ticketed seat since she isn't a lap child and had her own seat. The father replied that the child was sick so the mother was holding her. Very confused at the situation and where the child came from we proceeded to collect all of their boarding passes to try and figure it out. He handed the B-FA and myself 10 boarding passes total; for him and his group of 10. Each boarding pass had a ticketed seat that included no lap children. This family was scattered throughout the cabin and many of them were not in their correct ticketed seats making it even more challenging to solve. We noticed on the paper work that there was a non-revenue passenger assigned to seat 17D; who was actually sitting in 5F (the seat that belonged to the family of 10). Because the family was scattered all over the aircraft and not sitting in their correct seats we are unsure how the non-rev ended up in 5F and why there was another passenger in 17D.We notified the captain about the issue and we were all very confused how the gate agent boarded 70 people on a 69-seat aircraft. In conclusion we believe the gate agent forgot to scan one of the boarding passes for the family of ten; therefore she assigned a seat to a non-revenue passenger on a full flight. Had the woman not had been wearing a burkha and excessive dressings that covered the child-- the child would have most likely been noticed before take-off.",,,,"Air carrier Flight Attendant reported customer service boarded 70 passengers on their 69-seat aircraft and no one caught the error.",

He then handed me two; what looked like boarding passes and said that I needed to upgrade YYD to ZZD; as she was next on the upgrade list; and also pointed out that the other paper was an interrupted travel itinerary for PAX XXD. He then told me that the PAX in XXD may have had a bit too much to drink earlier so keep an eye on him.

'C' FA continued with her exit briefing and returned to front of cabin to tell 'A' FA exits briefed. Main cabin door had already been closed by operations agent. Taxiing out began performing demo when 'C' FA and a passenger noticed an overhead bin not completely closed. When opened; it was clear a bag would have to be moved as there was no more space onboard in overhead bins. A passenger sitting across in row 4 began the blame game with FA 'C' and getting other passengers very upset. I mentioned we would try to find room on the plane if needed. Called for FA 'B' and 'A' assistance because we were about to take off. 'A' FA was assisting when a very heavy metal box fell out hitting a passenger in the head then fell on the 'A's' foot. FA 'C' immediately asked FA 'B' to hold the bin shut while I attended to FA 'A' and passenger.During that time; the same passenger that complained earlier began getting louder saying 'it's all your fault' directing it to FA 'C.' FA 'C' called Captain and explained situation and took 2 bags of ice back to passenger and FA 'A.' Helped FA 'A' to jumpseat. Went back and checked on passenger while assisting FA 'B' to rearrange the bins and place some bags under seats. At that point; 2 or 3 passengers complained to FA 'C' it's all my fault that their flight will be delayed. Captain had called to see how FA 'A' was doing and she was in too much pain to talk. It turns out her toe was broken. She handed me the phone to talk with Captain. I told him in addition to the injuries we have several passengers yelling angrily about delays and fault and we need to go back to the gate.

Some is just a sense of entitlement and their rights to do as they wish regardless of our instructions. On this particular flight; passengers were getting up and using the restrooms on our approach.

He again stated he had never been told to do that. He opened it and started to remove paperwork and personal items; and the passenger next to him asked me if that was ok.

The gate agents assured them that the passenger would not be boarded. Just prior to push back flight attendant told me that the obviously intoxicated passenger was on the aircraft in the assigned seat. [This Flight Attendant is] specially trained in evaluating intoxicated individuals. He estimated the passenger's blood alcohol level at .20 BAC and explained in detail the symptoms of intoxication displayed by the passenger. I considered [this Flight Attendant] a reliable source. I requested a supervisor; [and was advised one] was already onboard the aircraft. The [Supervisor] entered the flight deck at my request. I asked him if the passenger was intoxicated. He replied that the passenger was intoxicated but that he did not consider him to be a 'security threat.' I advised him that I was not concerned with an intoxicated individual being a 'security threat' as much as I was concerned with him being a safety issue and a regulatory issue. I informed the [Supervisor] that I cannot legally allow an intoxicated passenger on the aircraft. The [Supervisor] asked me when an intoxicated individual is too intoxicated to fly. Although I found the mere question unsettling from a qualified [Supervisor]; I asked if he would let his wife and children ride in a car if the man; in his current condition; was driving the car. He quickly replied; 'Absolutely not.' I informed him that I would consider that as being a reasonable test to define intoxication. I waited several seconds for a response. The [Supervisor] neither offered any further explanation of the passenger's medical or physical condition nor did he make the decision to remove the passenger. I informed him that as Captain of the aircraft; I could not take an intoxicated passenger so he would have to be removed. The passenger staggered down the aisle and nearly fell on another passenger as [he was] assisted off the aircraft. [Flight Attendant] later told me that the [Supervisor] apologized to the passenger for my decision as the Captain to remove him and promised the passenger that he would be placed on the next fight in a couple of hours. A mere few hours is not enough time to diminish that level of intoxication. In accordance with 14 CFR 121.575; no certificate holder may allow any person to board any of its aircraft if that person appears to be intoxicated. The Supervisor knowingly placed an intoxicated passenger on the aircraft against the desires of his gate agents and the flight attendants. He seemed oblivious to the safety and regulatory issues in this matter. His behavior in apologizing to a clearly intoxicated passenger and promising to place him on the next flight; in front of my flight crew and passengers on the aircraft; sends a dangerous message to our customers and employees. One gate agent quietly apologized to me while explaining she did not want to board the passenger but she was overruled by the supervisor. The [Supervisor]'s promise to the passenger was disturbing; the fulfillment of that promise would be alarming. There was no question that the passenger was intoxicated; the crew told me he was intoxicated; the gate agents told me he was intoxicated; even the [Supervisor] told me he was intoxicated. [Supervisor] failed to follow policy and Federal Air Regulations applicable to airline operations.",,,,"A321 Captain reported a Customer Service Supervisor allowed an intoxicated passenger to board contrary to FAA regulations and company policy.",

There was no specific physical threat; so we did not declare an emergency; but I had to split my attention between monitoring ATC and speaking to the flight attendants.  The First Officer (FO) was Pilot Flying and we had just begun the descent on the MOLTN arrival.  Per SOP I continued to monitor ATC; and I heard the new clearance issued to fly direct WOOKY; then TISHNR arrival to DEN.  This clearance was very late; as we were only approximately 4NM from WOOKY and the next fix would now be different; as would the crossing altitudes.  I told the Flight Attendant (FA) that we would have Ground Security and Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) meet us at the gate and that I had to go.  I called 'back on one' and saw the FO attempting to get the new arrival entered into the FMS.  We were at about FL300 at 200KIAS in a very shallow descent.  It took me a moment to assess the situation; as my moving map showed WOOKY ahead but we were not moving towards it; and when the FO activated direct WOOKY in the FMS; we were not proceeding in that direction and a discontinuity appeared below with the remainder of the STAR disappearing.  I couldn't immediately determine whether it was an entry error or FMS malfunction; so I asked ATC for a heading to WOOKY while we reprogrammed the FMS.  He told us to turn 5 degrees left.  Then he told us to go direct to RAMMS; which gave us enough time to properly program the remainder of the STAR.  Once on our route; I asked the FO whether he set 200 KIAS; or if the FMS commanded that.  He said that he couldn't remember.  I returned to FMS speeds since as far as I could tell we were supposed to be at 250 KIAS as per the STAR.  At that moment; ATC asked if we were going to make it down.  We were still in a shallow descent; so I steepened it; deployed the speedbrakes; and said yes.  He gave us a new frequency.  I checked in and realized that we could not make the next crossing altitude.  I informed ATC and he told us to descend and maintain 13;000 feet.  We complied and I asked if he needed the speed restrictions but he said to just worry about the altitude first.  When we reached 13;000 feet; he cleared us to 11;000 feet; then gave us a last minute runway change to 17R.  We entered the approach in the FMS; then he told us to turn to intercept the 17R localizer.  When he gave us that clearance; the localizer course was already behind us.  Realizing his error; ATC asked us if we had the airport in sight.  We replied that we did; made the right turn to intercept the final approach course and flew the remainder of the approach in green needles to a safe landing.I had to address this cabin emergency and leave the FO at a time when DEN ATC decided to give multiple last minute instructions.  Even if I were able to devote my full attention to Pilot Monitoring duties; this would have been a challenging clearance to accept with so little time.  The FO was effectively single pilot momentarily; and he was overwhelmed with these last minute changes.  Assigning a different STAR at that point changed the entire descent planning of the aircraft. So we needed a few moments to even determine whether it was possible at that point to make all the STAR restrictions.  From the time I got off the interphone with the FAs we received several route; altitude; speed and frequency changes; many at the same time.  At the end of the descent to get a last minute approach change and a vector in the wrong direction just added to an already too high workload situation.The situation in the cabin needed to be addressed; as I had to assess whether we had a cabin emergency or not.  Per SOP I monitored ATC; but I believe that DEN ATC's last minute instructions are a hazard even in normal operations.  It can be a challenge to program a new arrival in the [this aircraft]; and we are required afterward to verify that we can make all published restrictions.  This kind of short notice change greatly increases the probability of route errors and altitude or speed deviations in my opinion.",,,,"An Embraer RJ Captain reported difficulty complying with last minute ATC changes to route; altitude; and speeds while at the same time dealing with a passenger issue in the cabin.",

Our APU was running and the winds were gusting from the northwest which was directly towards our tail at the gate.My first officer and I also discussed the likely possibility of a fuel spill somewhere near us on the ramp. In my experience on this aircraft is it is not uncommon to get a faint; exhaust like fume smell in the air conditioning system and thick condensation during hot; muggy summer nights such as this one was. I assume the smell was stronger in the cabin than in the cockpit since both the FO (First Officer) and I had our air vents closed. The flight attendants requested that I make a PA stating that everything was ok and there was no cause for alarm and we are aware of the condensation and smell; which I did. The two forward flight attendants also informed me that 'they opened the doors in back' which I thought meant that the two rear flight attendants had opened the rear aircraft doors for ventilation. Our number three and one FA's (Flight Attendant) meant to inform me that passengers were exiting through the over wing exits. This was a simple misunderstanding that was caused by task saturation in the cockpit; monitoring the APU indications; and determining the cause of the smell.I was later informed that passengers took it upon themselves to open all four over wing exits and exit onto the wing. I was told that it was estimated that 15-20 people were on each wing at one point. Our number two flight attendant vocally told passengers to stop exiting through the over wing exits. She had no chance to prevent passengers from initiating the uncommanded evacuation given the crowded aisle and interior that is typical of everyone standing when the seat belt sign is turned off. Our number four flight attendant made a PA instructing passengers to stop and to not evacuate or exit though the over wing exits. I did not hear this PA.The FO and I opened our air vents and the fuel odor got stronger and the condensation thickened. I then shut off the Ram Air; APU AIR switch; and both packs; which caused the fuel smell to lessen considerably in intensity and the condensation stopped completely. A man who works the ramp came up to the cockpit and told us we had fuel leaking out of the APU. I then told him to connect external power and I began to shut down the APU. I also told the first officer to go outside and inspect the APU fuel leak with the ops personnel. We informed ground of the fuel leak and we requested ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting) to come inspect the area as a precaution; which they did.I was told by the gate agent that only one person had jumped off the left wing. I was told by operations and my flight attendants that a few passengers came back into the airplane through the over wing doors; and the rest exited the wings on baggage belt loaders. There were no injuries that I know of. This was confirmed by all four flight attendants and operations personnel. Upon inspection of the APU; fuel was in fact leaking out of the non-ram door area and the fuel spill was about fifteen feet in diameter. I was instructed by maintenance to pull 5 circuit breakers; which I did; secured the airplane with the securing check; and made the appropriate entries in the maintenance logbook.",,,,"After parking at arrival gate aircraft experienced an APU fuel leak.

Whenever any passenger requested any sort of assistance from medical to a snack we were providing it to them. Flight attendants were making attempt to inform our base supervisor and crew services of the situations taking place on the aircraft. XA:30Pilot informed Lead Flight Attendant (LFA) of diversion to a nearby airport. The landing was going to take place rather fast. At this time LFA informed the other flight attendants of the diversion. Pilot In Command (PIC) made the PA announcement that the flight will be landing in ZZZ due to unable to land at our filed destination due to weather. LFA followed up with a PA announcement indicating the diversion. Also; stated for flight attendants to begin preparing the cabin for arrival. XA:454 chimes - Flight attendants picked up remaining service items and LFA did final compliance walk for landing. XB:02 (Actual)LFA made the arrival announcement.XB:05Aircraft was parked on Tarmac. LFA began Tarmac record. LFA pulled up Tarmac Delay information in [the Ipad]. Passengers begin standing in the aisle stretching legs and standing in line for the 3 lavatories on board. XB:25 [A] Passenger's wife came forward to the galley and stated husband is feeling very nauseous. FA 3 provided his wife with ginger ale; water; trash bag and offered a snack. At this time she refused a snack for him. Then [FA 3] followed passengers to seat to assess.XB:32LFA advised PIC we were in need of our official block out time for delay record. Instead of the block out time PIC informed lead we do not have this time since we are sitting on an active Tarmac. Instead noted and gave the arrival time into the divert airport. XB:42 PIC made announcement we were expecting to depart ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 in about an 1 hour and fifteen minutes. This would give the crew an ETA into our original destination of XC:57. With this ETA given lead then discussed with Flight Deck (FD) the potential for a pour service to be needed. Flight attendants were advised against a pour and snack service to be conducted. XC:00Passengers came forward and stated she was a diabetic and insulin was under the plane. She said she was due for it in about an hour. If we could give her some M&M's and water she would be fine until the delay is completed. Even though this was a medical related issue we did not have to ask for a doctor. Flight deck was notified by LFA. From XB:02 till XC:00 all doors on the aircraft were armed during the tarmac delay! XC:06 The flight deck made an announcement that the aircraft would be taxing to a different fueling area. LFA made prior to aircraft movement announcement minus electronic devices to ensure compliance before saying it was safe to move aircraft. LFA walked the cabin to ensure compliance. FA 2 and 4 were seated in jump seat with aft barrier strap up. FA 2 stated aft cabin secure. A single chime [to] flight deck to signal cabin was ready for movement. Flight deck then called and asked if we were ready for movement. LFA stated to captain 'this is why I single chimed you'.XC:20 Aircraft arrived at fueling area. Captain asked if doors were armed if so they needed to be disarmed because we were about to fuel. LFA made the announcement FA prepare doors for arrival.XC:23 [FA 3] who injured himself earlier on the deicing fluid in the cabin while stowing his baggage before departure FA 2 saw him limping. FA 2 called forward to ask if there was [a] bandage in the First aid kit. LFA looked at the items in our First Aid kit and we did not have [a] bandage. FA 2 came forward to get ice for the customer. XC:27[Another] passenger who had Claustrophobia came forward to the bulk head just looking for space away from other passengers and crew members. Crew members remembered this passenger from the previous week flight. Atthis point we noticed [passenger] very hot; sweaty and in a panic. She was saying can I just get air! She then began vomiting in the trash bag in the galley. LFA made the announcement of do we have any doctors or nurses on board and if so can you ring your FA call button. At this time LFA also notified the flight deck of the situation and we were filling out a cabin report. While the nurse who was chosen by [flight crew] as our medical personnel from mid cabin to come forward. LFA stayed with the passenger ensuring her everything was going to be ok and we were working with the FD for passengers to get off the aircraft.XC:29 PIC headed to aft of the aircraft to do a walk around. PIC asked flight attendants 2 and 4 to hold and watch the tail cone door exit. At this time he went down the steps the FA had deemed to be 'hazardous'.XC:31First Officer (FO) called [FA] into the FD after the cabin report had been given to them. With the cabin report [medical services] was contacted. Once [medical services] was contacted FO gave [FA] his personal cell phone to have the conversation with [medical services]. [Medical services] advised the passenger to begin doing breathing exercises. [Medical services] wanted the use of [oxygen]. [A FA] got the [oxygen] uncovered the mask and the customer felt like it would make her become more claustrophobic. On the cabin report the only medication the passenger stated she had taken was Gravol. At the time I did not know what Gravol was. Passenger said it was motion sickness medicine. When I was writing this report I researched what this drug is. According to [website] Gravol is a new synthetic drug. It is highly addictive and makes users dangerously paranoid; to the point of suicide. It also causes paranoia; kidney failure; hallucination. During the conversation with [medical services] I initiated a crew to crew call with [medical services]. During this short called I asked her to come forward and help with the passenger. [Medical services] at this time stated that the only medicine in our Medical kit which could be administered to the passengers was Benadryl. Passengers refused the Benadryl as well and stated the Gravol should work. Passenger asked if she could sit in a seat in the bulkhead. One of the passengers in [bulkhead seat] heard this comment be made and was willing to move to [passengers] seat. [passenger] thanked the guy in [bulkhead] for doing this for us. [Passenger] calmed down once this decision was made. XC:40 FA 4 stated beverage and snack service as requested was needed for the cabin. Lead had lost track of time during the medicals and everything else; which was taking place in the cabin. Lead notified FD pour service was beginning. XC:41 FA immediately began pour service. We used the plastic bins inside the carts lined them up with cups and started pouring water into them. During this pour service we ran out of water on the carts and crew water. The only water we had left was the water bottles the crew had already drank out of. This service was completed by the 120 minute mark of the delay. XD:19Lead notified Captain we were right at the 3 hour mark of the delay. Passengers even after the service began getting upset. LFA notified flight deck the passengers were beginning to get upset. During the Tarmac delay instead of using the Interphone system to communicate with lead. The flight deck was just opening the door to have communication. LFA ask flight deck if we can go to normal procedures to open the door due how the passengers were being. At this time LFA notified captain that we are getting close to that 3 hour mark of the delay. Asked captain to make another announcement. XD:21Captain advised lead we were about to taxi to gate. FA prepare doors for departure announcement was made. Aircraft was prepared for taxi to the gate. FA did compliance check.XD:27 Announcement was made to prepare doors for arrival. Captain notified FA that the aft stairs would be used for deplaning. FA 2 notified lead the aft stairs were not safe to deplane off of due to the slick liquid (De icing liquid) on the stairs. LFA notified Crew services we did not feel it was safe. They advised us that passengers should take all belongings because there was a chance the plane was going to get Remain Overnight (RON) for the night in the divert airport.XE:30 Captain advised to deplane from the aft stairs even though FA advised against it. As soon as this announcement was made passengers began deplaning prior to LFA finishing her conversation with her supervisor. Once off the phone LFA advised passengers to take all carry on luggage with them down the back stairs of the aircraft and use caution exiting. During the deplaning process [ill passenger's] bag was taken in. LFA asked FD if she could exit aircraft to retrieve her bag. They told LFA to have her contact our supervisor. During the time frame of XE:50 and XG:45[Ill passengers] exited the aircraft not long after the passengers did to deplane. When [medical services] got back onto the plane they stated the passengers are in the terminal area and no one is giving them any updates. They just wanted the pilots or some airline employee to give some updates! XG:45 Began boarding again up the tail cone stairs; which was contaminated with both snow and the deicing fluid. FD asked LFA if we were ok with doing this. After discussion with the crew we decided since they already deplaned off these stairs. It's not safe but [might] as well board and get to our filed destination! Now while boarding the water from snow melting in combination with the deicing fluid made more of the aisle way slick. Just like it was in the departure airport. The flight attendants tried to [mitigate] any risk while boarding and LFA made boarding announcements like normal. While boarding a gentleman near the front of the aircraft stated his name was not on the manifest the gate agent was using. LFA notified flight deck. LFA told the flight deck this could be seen as a security issue. PIC stated a gate agent must tell the flight deck no security issues prior to pushing back. After it appeared boarding was complete FA 2 completed a count when I read the verification announcement. FA's noted we were missing 8 people. This was verified by the gate agent giving FA 2 the names of the individuals to read on the PA. The FA 2 told passengers to ring their FA call buttons if they were on board. FA 4 and 3 re briefed exit rows. PIC handed the paper work through the window of the aircraft to a gate agent. LFA stated 'Cabin Secure!; Clear to Close?' I single chimed FD indicating we were ready for push back. FA 3 asked lead if she was ok with doing the safety demo and she would read the safety demo. I said yes and I did the safety demo in the cabin. After the safety demo I walked down the aisle to ensure compliance again. Once I got back informed passengers we would be dimming the cabin lights for departure and read the deicing announcement. XH:15Finally; we landed in our originally filed destination. Arrival announcement was made and we apologized for the delay. Also; stated use caution when exiting the aircraft and getting carry on luggage out of the over head bins. LFA made the FA prepare doors for arrival announcement was made. LFA did her cabin sweep of any left items and cross checked all doors were not armed.XH:58 Crew called crew services to find out information about ride to hotel; what hotel we are staying in and what our show time is for the next day. Finally got the [hotel] our crew was dead tired. We all just wanted to check in and put our heads on a pillow. The day had used every ounce of energy we had.

I started to take notice in mid-January when I had to write up a PAX who became intoxicated brought on by his own sake and Japanese beers. He stated that he bought them in the airport specifically to enjoy on our flight. My next incident came out of ZZZ and a gentleman was eating his deli sandwich and had a Bud Light out on the tray table. I have been picking up mini bottles of liquor that we do not sell. Mini bottles are being sold next to the kiosk in ZZZ1. A PAX in front of me at a restaurant in ZZZ2 bought a 22 oz can of beer. None of these restaurants are opening the alcohol that is purchased - allowing and making customers believe that it is alright to consume on board. It is not. It is a FAR. This needs to be addressed. The easiest solution I see; is adding another sentence following our demo announcements after saying smoking is not allowed. Consumption of personal alcohol is not as well. Or reinstating placards on the jet bridges saying that it is a finable offense; maybe passengers will heed their consumption. Our terminals are all becoming overridden with bars that line all concourses. We need to be able to monitor some consumption. In my opinion it is getting more out of control than I have ever seen.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported and observed an increase in the number of incidents of intoxicated passengers who have brought alcohol onboard flights for their own consumption during the flight.

I answered the call. The flight attendant sounded excited and told me that there was smoke/fumes coming from one of the aft lav trash bins. She wanted to talk to the Captain so I transferred the issue to the Captain. After the initial conversation with the flight attendant the Captain told me to contact ATC to immediately return and that I have control of the airplane. We were given priority direct and descend. The Captain also directed that we execute the smoke and fumes checklist while he continued the conversation with the flight attendant. We accomplished the emergency procedures checklist; flew fast and expedited our descent. Slowly the information coming from the back of the airplane was that the situation was under control and that there appeared to be no more smoke/fumes coming from the trash bin. ATC asked if we wanted a closer airport but we declined after determining that the situation was not as dire as first thought. We coordinated with ATC; dispatch; the flight attendants and operations that our arrival plan was to have the emergency response vehicles follow us to a gate and then have the firemen board the airplane as a precaution to assess the problem. Landed without incident. After arrival at the gate it was discovered that a passenger had entered the lavatory; smoked an e-cigarette and blew the smoke into the open trash bin. After the smoking passenger left the lav the next passenger discovered smoke coming from the trash bin and reported it to the flight attendant. The biggest threat in my opinion was the communications problems associated with using the smoke goggles. Trying to communicate simultaneously with ATC; flight attendants and each other was very difficult. We also later learned that we had a pass riding Captain in the back that could have really helped in the communication in the back of the airplane but at the time we were unaware that he was there.",,"We had a normal takeoff and everything was fine until we reached cruise altitude. I had the first officer turn off seat belt sign once at cruise. The lead flight attendant called just after reaching cruise. The first officer answered but then gave inter-phone to me. She said the Lav (aft right) trash bin was emitting smoke and fumes. She could not determine the source of smoke or fumes. I instructed her to fight the smoke by using extinguisher either halon or water whichever could stop the smoke. We accomplished the emergency procedure for smoke and fumes; informed ATC; and ran QRH clean up items. We also reviewed LAV smoke checklist. The most difficult part of our work was talking to ATC and Flight Attendants (FAs) with oxygen mask on. ATC gave us a clearance direct and a descent to FL200. Within the next 4 minutes; I called FA to ask status of smoke and fumes from trash bin. She said smoke had cleared and she smelled some remnant of the fumes but they dumped full bottle of water into the bin. They had pulled bin out and check it's contents but there was only wet paper towels. We decided to continue to our departure airport instead of diverting to a closer one; once FA informed us smoke was cleared. We then removed our oxygen masks and used normal communications. Soon a pass riding 737 Captain who did not check in with us called to inform us that neither one of the squibs in trash bin had discharged.We contacted dispatch and informed them of our smoke and fume problem and that we were returning. We would have emergency personnel follow us to the gate. We expedited our descent and landed after running normal checklist items. Once we arrive at gate we had passengers remain in seats until fire personnel could evaluate aft Lav. I then talked to FA again and fire personnel as we tried to determine cause of smoke and fumes. I asked if she remembered what passenger was in Lav just before smoke was discovered. She did not remember but then a female passenger stood to say she could recognize person if she saw him again. We went to jet bridge where police were waiting.

Two Flight Attendants intercepted the Passenger and led him to the aft galley area where he continued to make irrational statements. Lockdown was immediately instituted as well as all Level 1 threat protocols. I instructed the FA's to clear the back row of the aircraft and locate two passengers to be Able Bodied Assistants (ABA) willing to assist them. I instructed the F/A's to seat this Passenger between the ABAs and if he was not compliant; he was to be secured with tuff cuffs and seated between them. I also asked them to locate any Medical Personnel onboard for further assessment of the Passengers condition. One of the ABAs was in fact an EMT.I notified Dispatch (via ACARS) of a Level One threat in progress. After gaining further information from the Flight Attendants we initiated voice contact with Dispatch and then a phone patch (via ARINC) with Medical and Dispatch. The decision was made to divert and have both EMS and Law Enforcement meet the aircraft as well as Maintenance for an overweight landing. The Passenger's behavior remained at Level One; but based on the information from the Flight Attendants I felt it could very quickly escalate; thus the request for Law Enforcement. Based on the medical evaluation and all available information I felt this Passenger was in need of either medical or Law Enforcement intervention. The flight crew coordinated the diversion through Dispatch; ran the diversion checklist and proceeded. The aircraft was met by Law Enforcement and EMS upon arrival. Law Enforcement entered through the aft service door along with EMS. The Passenger was secured and removed via the aft service door. I believe that Law Enforcement boarded the ambulance with the Passenger for transport. A logbook entry was made for the overweight landing and notification made to Maintenance through Dispatch. Additional notifications through Dispatch to the Supervisor of Dispatch as well as the Chief Pilot on Call were made. Maintenance completed the overweight landing inspection and returned the aircraft to service. I spent a few minutes with each Flight Attendant and made sure they were ok; and ok to continue our last leg.

I could hear through my headset and the flight deck door some sort of commotion that sounded like voices. I thought it was slightly unusual; but we were close to landing; [and] I wasn't sure if the flight attendants were simply doing their last minute duties before landing. On the landing rollout turn onto a high speed taxiway; we got a call from the flight attendants. My Captain and I recognized it and both agreed we were going to address it as soon as we completed our after landing duties since we were still slowing down and in a very high workload environment between the normal flows; checklist; and call to ops. Before we could complete our after landing flows; however; the flight attendants then called using the 'emergency' call button. The Captain immediately stopped the plane and informed ATC while I talked to the flight attendants. The flight attendants told us we had a belligerent passenger; who had taken her seat belt off during approach and was walking around the cabin. I relayed this information to the Captain. We tried to ascertain what the current status of the passenger was to determine if she was still a threat. The flight attendants said she had returned to her seat with her seat belt fastened. Following the Captain's direction; I asked the flight attendant if they thought we needed a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) to meet us at the gate; since the information we were getting appeared to indicate that the passenger had returned to her seat and fastened her seat belt and was complying. After a pause and the flight attendant's clear hesitation on making this decision; I suggested that we'd have a LEO meet us at the gate; which the flight attendants agreed was a good decision. I called ops; and worked through arranging a LEO to meet us at the gate. Unfortunately; in the chaos ops didn't know we were on the ground in LAX because our ACARS had failed midair on that leg. This resulted in some delay getting the ground crew to the gate to marshal us in and then waiting for the LEO to meet us at the gate after we had parked. We delayed deplaning the aircraft until the LEO could escort the passenger off the plane.I saw the passenger briefly in the jet bridge hitting the LEO while the LEO explained to her that she would be arrested [if] she didn't stop. I left to do my walk around; and when I returned; I saw her being carried away in handcuffs by two LEOs up the jet bridge.As the incident occurred we were informed that it was alcohol-related; and the passenger was clearly intoxicated. She had been served two alcoholic beverages during the flight; and according to the flight attendants; was perfectly normal after 1; but the second resulted in her belligerent behavior.Passengers being disruptive are a part of air travel; but there were a few lessons I learned to help make it smoother with less operational disruptions. First; explain to the flight attendants that they should let us know quickly if there's a potential problem. On final approach; one of us could conceivably have answered a call early on knowing there was simply an issue with a passenger. Then we could have called back when we had finished our initial after landing duties and better managed the workload.While the Captain and I performed great CRM during the whole event (clearly dividing who was doing what - Captain did taxiing and communicating with ATC while I talked with the flight attendants and coordinated with ops); things changed when our first form of communication with the flight attendants was after they had pushed the emergency call button. The Captain and I both feared when we saw that light go on that we might have been on fire or some other emergency requiring evacuation onto the taxiway. The Captain later informed the flight attendants that we were going to get to the situation as quickly as it was safe to do so; but the emergency callbutton might not have been necessary since at the time they called the passenger was in her seat with her seat belt fastened.Finally; I believe one of the important things for the flight attendants to learn is how much we pilots rely on them to paint a picture of what is happening in the cabin in a situation like this. Initially when they called up; it sounded like it was a minor issue that was under control and wouldn't require any special assistance; and it took a long time to come to the conclusion to pull the trigger on having security meet us at the gate. When we exited the flight deck at the gate; the Captain and I agreed that there was no doubt we needed security to meet us (and the Captain commented that if she'd been displaying that behavior when she boarded the flight; she would have still been in [departure airport] at the gate); as even though she was in her seat; she still was not complying with instructions and posing a threat to those around her (as evidenced by her repeatedly hitting the calm LEO while in the jet bridge). Having gotten this information better communicated to us would have allowed us to get to the gate quicker since we were stopped on the taxiway during the whole conversation with the flight attendants. While in this incident it did not make a difference; a different situation might result in a passenger being more physically aggressive; making a quick decision allow for a sooner end to the scenario with less damage or injury to passengers and crew. And while not as important; a quicker decision would have also mitigated some of the delay that this incident caused to the remaining flights of the day.",,,,"Air Carrier First Officer reported that an unruly passenger disrupted the cabin shortly before landing.",

I responded that being rude wasn't sufficient reason to remove passenger and she should have another flight attendant deal with the passenger and just avoid any issues with that passenger. She came back to cockpit a couple of minutes later and said the lady in question was getting really nasty and she wanted to remove her again. I then called for the gate agent; who knew before I told him which passenger we were having a problem with because she had gotten really upset at the gate when they asked her to check her bags and apparently was rude there also. I asked him to just calm her down; and told him if she could be polite and quiet; she could stay on the aircraft and we could leave.About 3 minutes later the flight attendant came forward and claimed the lady assaulted her by intentionally 'kneeing' her when she passed her in the aisle and trying to hurt her. I realized this had escalated to a threat level 2; and went back to the agent who was getting an earful from the passenger and instructed him to remove the passenger from the aircraft. The passenger heard me tell him to remove her and got very upset.I went back and stood at the door to the cockpit. The passenger was getting louder with each step forward; and one of the other flight attendants had told me that in first class an off duty Sheriff had offered to intervene if necessary. As the passenger came forward in the aisle yelling at me personally about being a racist pilot for removing her; I pointed at the exit door and said politely that she needed to leave before we called the police. She yelled that all of the flight crew were racists and she was going to sue us all; but would not exit the aircraft as she stood in the door and prevented us from closing it to depart the gate. I suggested the gate agents call the police at that point.I then asked the Sherriff if he would intervene and make sure she didn't assault anyone else as she was very agitated and getting physically close to the gate agents and one of the flight attendants. He showed her his credentials as she moved out onto the jetway where she continued to berate the gate agents. The Sheriff got back on board and we closed the door.Before push back; I turned from my cockpit window and observed the passenger still in the jet way berating everyone; and yelling at me. She then flipped me off as we pushed back; which was so unexpected; it caused me to chuckle slightly. She promptly pulled up a cell phone and recorded me chuckling. The flipping off was witnessed by my lead flight attendant and the gate agent.",,,,"An air carrier Captain reported removing a passenger for misconduct before departure.",

When we secured the cabin before door closure they were all in their seat belts; but after we closed the MCD (Main Cabin Door) and started the safety pre-departure announcement and demo; the little girl got out of her seat and stood next to her mother. The mother made no effort to get her child back in her seat. We stopped the demo and I managed to get her back in her seat belt and tried to indicate to her brother that she needed to stay there. We finished the demo; secured the cabin and taxied out to the runway. We were in line to take off and were expecting our takeoff chime when the little girl got up again. This time the mother picked her up and put her on her lap. Even though she appeared to be over two years of age; I felt that getting up to rectify the situation at that phase of the flight was not safe as it would take some time to get her settled again and decided to leave the child held on her mother's lap for takeoff. As soon as it was safe for us to get up; I went back to the mother and decided to rearrange the children to try to avoid a repeat incident. I tried to indicate that the little boy sitting next to her should go to the row behind and that she should strap the little girl into the seat next to her. There was very little cooperation from any of them; including the mother; but I finally got the little boy strapped into the seat one row back and the little girl seated next to her mother and in her seat belt. She fell asleep and stayed there for the rest of the flight.There was a big language barrier and complete lack of understanding of airplane safety and regulations.

When the little girl got up the first time; during the demo; I alerted the flight deck that we might have a problem with an unsecured child over two years old. When I got her seated; the CA (Captain) said that if she was secured; we were going to go.

Several passengers at mid cabin and aft cabin were non-compliant of takeoff instructions and the D and B FA were addressing the issue. Securing the cabin was taking a little longer than normal due to non-compliant passengers. Pilots signaled the cleared for takeoff ding. The 'A' flight attendant did not answer and confirm with pilots that cabin was secured due to the fact that flight attendants were still addressing non-compliant passengers. 'A' flight attendant observed aircraft taxi onto runway and immediately went into take off phase. 'A' flight attendant immediately made pa announcement to all flight attendants to take their seats and secure themselves. 'A' flight attendant was not able to notify the Captain in time to delay take off due to sterile flight deck. Captain did not ask for verbal confirmation if cabin and flight attendants were secured. When we landed and Captain was informed of what happen; there was no concern or remorse from his part and when asked why did he takeoff without confirming cleared for takeoff signal from the 'A' flight attendant his response was 'I heard talk so I assumed you were secured.' I feel there was a breakdown in communication between pilots and flight attendants.Breakdown in communication occurred between the pilots and flight attendants and needs to be addressed. A more paced taxi should take place to allow flight attendants enough time to secure the cabin; galleys and themselves in jump seats including performing the emergency demo on a very short taxi especially at smaller airports. And finally we should possibly add to the present response we have in place to the pilots [something to the effect of reminding passengers to check your seat belts and that the cabin and flight attendants are secure.]",,,,"B737 Flight Attendant reported a takeoff before the cabin was secured due to some noncompliant passengers and no communication with the flight crew.",

I said; 'Sir; here is a place you can place your bag.' He then kind of swung it my way; as if I was to take it from him. I said; 'No; Sir; place in here (pointing);' as he seemed just a bit off agitated; or just frustrated coming on late; and I thought he was late or flying on a pass; as we were preparing the cabin for departure (not thinking he could be detained; and a last minute decision about his behavior/or intoxication and whether or not he should be allowed to fly). I am not aware of this; but after speaking to a witness; who came forward later after the disturbance; who stated she was harassed by Passenger X; I am wondering if that is why he was so late getting on. He also seemed a bit disheveled; but that is the only contact I had with him until the second/follow on service. I suspect that something happened in flight; either he had his own alcohol or used drugs; as he was only served one beer by flight attendant #3; I believe. The next time I had any communications with Passenger X; was when I was trying to serve the passengers on the opposite of side of him and he kept on; in an obvious slurred speech in an aggressive tone; 'I want her to get me a drink!' He was extremely rude; impatient; and bordering belligerent. I didn't know if he had some physical problems or if he was intoxicated. At every request on the ABC side; I turned and said; 'Just a minute; I will be on this side next.' I repeated and kindly stated over and over; 'Sir; it will be just a minute.' When it was his turn; he was almost inaudible and moving around saying 'Get me a drink; I want a High Can!' It was so hard to understand him; and I was trying to see this is the way he talks; or is he intoxicated. I said; 'You want a Heineken Beer; right?' As I remember seeing another beer that he had before (different brand); so I know he had at least one. I asked him if he had; had any alcohol before the flight; and again; slurred speech; agitated movement. 'He grumbled at me; 'NO; NO; I hadn't had no alcohol; NO NO!' With this remark; he appeared intoxicated; as I had not thought of drug use before; but what alarmed me; he had cigarettes on his tray table. I asked; 'Sir; are you are aware that you cannot smoke at any time on the flight anywhere? Yeah; (again slurred; gruff; and agitated speech) I know; I know; I fly every day; every day!' Like he wanted to hurt me with his words...a little startling. At some time; he pulls out a large wad of cash with large bills; when I am debating as I have the beer in my hand. Sir; you do know; since you fly so often; you cannot pay with cash; you can only pay with a credit card. At this time; he takes his credit card that apparently he had in his hand; an pushes it towards my face and says; 'SEE I HAVE A CREDIT CARD; SEE; SEE!' and repeats his words over and over. Now he is belligerent; and starts a scene and I get into my authoritative tone and say; 'Do not be rude to a crew member; you need to calm down!' I repeated these words; and he started mocking me over and over. At this point I went up front to TRY and explain the situation; but I am not able to very well; as the FA#1 only wants to hear a part of what has taken place; but at least he is not cowering away like most. I said; 'In good conscious; I cannot serve any one who appears intoxicated but I need for you to wait I need to finish.' I tried to explain; and told him that he also has a pack of cigarettes out which is another concern if he plans to...and off FA1 goes. I continued the service with #2; and I could hear a bit what was going on; and FA1 asking him as I did; if he would put those away so all would feel comfortable about it; but this request continued and continued...I heard 'because I asked you to so nicely.' I later learned that Passenger X threatened to punch out FA1. FA# 3 came up to me; as she was picking up behind the cart; and she says; he wants to go to the bathroom and we both said; 'We cannot send him up towards the cockpit; not like this; intoxicated; and if he has those cigarettes. Then I see Passenger X coming up staggering towards me with his iPhone yelling and ranting in the aisle. As we were trying to finish at row 25-30 the last drinks; and his saying; I am recording you. Yelling this: 'They won't let me go to the bathroom; I am recording you; as he talks in the phone saying: 'They won't let me go to the bathroom!' I told him to calm down; and with my international stop sign; said to stop recording; it is a violation and repeated to stop; and that his phone needs to be in airplane mode (don't ask me why I said that; but anything at this point); and it is a Federal violation (as he would not comply after repeated requests). I said; calm down; and sit down; as we will be out of the way soon. I twice requested to the #2 that we get this cart out of the aisle now; as I was concerned for my safety and the passengers; 'Let's move it now; the red wine can wait; we will get that later!' Get the cart out of the aisle; he is coming this way; quickly. As soon as we got the cart out of the way; Passenger X sat down. I had spoken to one of the two men who were kind enough to block the aisle to the cockpit; as he asked can we get the marshal to assist or any on board. We did not have one; so it helped having them in the aisle; so that Passenger X did not proceed toward the cockpit; as I noted what they were doing. I asked to repeat the same if this passenger continues this irrational behavior; or tries to go to the cockpit.We waited and he would not come back; so a passenger stated you need to go tell him that the cart is out of the way; because he may claim racism. I explained that I believe I need for him to calm down before I approach him; at this point; but we will get to that. She volunteered as she said he had been nice to HER in the terminal area; and I said; I will be right here (close proximity); if she feels comfortable. (This is interesting; as we have volunteers who gave their name about how Passenger X harassing them in the terminal as mentioned; and there was an extreme difference in the two ages). This female passenger approached him and I stood three rows behind; not in view. She said; 'Oh; he seems so remorseful.' Passenger X never came to the back restrooms; so I asked a passenger who is a [company] mechanic (same race) if he could identify himself as a [company] employee; and see if he would need to use the restroom; as I felt that he would be an approachable; not someone with a uniform on. He came to us; and said; 'He is definitely intoxicated; and he said he is Okay; doesn't need to go to the restroom.' #2 and I discussed the fact that not until the cart was past his seat did he need to go to the restroom; and #2 stated that he remembers on the first service he made us move the cart for him. When I tried to tell the Captain the situation in the aft area; I noted FA1 interrupting; so I let him speak; he would let me go ahead and he would talk over me; so I am sure the Captain got partial; but the Captain was aware there was definitely a disturbance and I was most involved. The one thing that was asked; 'Do you think it is necessary to have the police meet the flight met?' Yes; of course; and said why; Level one; the filming; the violations; belligerent behavior; intoxication; and now I believe drug use. I know the disturbance form was given to him; and I knew FA1 had been threatened; and it was a definite need to have the police meet the flight; however; I was NEVER expecting that the police would refuse to take my statement. I had not even gotten off the plane before the Customer Service Manager wanted it closed out; the Captain/and two flight attendants stated they were not pressing charges and the Captain knew; and the #1 and #3 that I was involved. FA1 heard my conversation; at least what I was trying to state; of the threats the intimidation and the violations in back. The Captain knew I was most involved; so to not to take my statement insults my needs; and possibly my civil rights. I was told by the police and TSA that I cannot press charges; as we have already closed out the incident; and we have released him to go to the next flight.We learned; as I was having a conversation with the police; since I was most insistent of having my statement taken and not be totally disregarded; as I was the most involved. I was only given a form with phone numbers that do not even work; however; it did provide me with the necessary information; as this man was not right (call it instinct) and no one wanted to listen. The Captain stated the reason he did not press charges; is that he would have to call the FBI. The #3 said; 'She is used to her children saying [slur]!' and the 2 year flight attendant; FA1 appeared happy; but thought Passenger X was not going to be able to go to his next flight; I may have misunderstood but that is what I thought he said; and that was not the case at all. Passenger X was allowed to go to his next flight to cause another disturbance on his flight. Police were called away and someone asked; 'Is this for the same man?' It MOST certainly was; so Passenger X we learned was removed from that flight and [company] gave him a voucher for a hotel; and rebooked him the next day.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported encountering an apparently intoxicated and belligerent passenger during inflight service.

As I was contemplating asking if he needed to use his concentrator during all phases of the flight; I checked my manifest and noticed he wasn't even listed as having an O2 concentrator. As I was about to ask him a question or two; the passenger in 13B asked me if his (12B) O2 bottle ran out; would we have O2 bottles for him to use on board. I almost chuckled as I said 'he's not using O2 from a bottle; it's an O2 concentrator; but we have no info about it even being on board.' She replied that he indeed was using an O2 bottle as he has lung cancer and only 25% use of one of his lungs. I must have had a very odd look on my face as I said 'but he can't bring his own O2 bottle on board an aircraft; totally not allowed!' 'How did you get past the TSA?' She said they discovered the bottle; took it; checked it out; and returned it saying it was okay. My comment was 'they what?' 'So; no one else was informed that you had this and intended to use it on the plane? Turn it off please; now.' I went and retrieved one of our Portable Oxygen Bottles (POBs) and asked the D flight attendant to tell the A flight attendant to notify the flight deck. The passenger in 13B was the girlfriend of the passenger in 12B. She also told me he has used his own POB on many other flights before. She didn't say which airline.Being the C flight attendant; I'm not allowed to be forward of the exit rows for boarding; nor would I leave my cabin area of responsibility prior to takeoff. After takeoff; I'm setting up my cart as the B and D flight attendants are [completing other service duties]. So; not sure how I could have done anything different due to my position. Had I been working a position where I would have seen Mr. [12 B] on what I would have assumed was an O2 concentrator; I would have looked at my manifest to see if he was listed as using one. I would have then asked him if he needed to use it during all phases of flight including takeoff and landing; where I may have asked to move him to a window seat so as not to block/hamper other passengers egress to the main aisle in an emergency. That exchange most likely would have brought about a discovery of an O2 bottle and not a concentrator.I think lesson #1 is never assume a darn thing! Many passengers are not aware they need to disclose plans to use an O2 concentrator and I have watched them come onboard only to discover they aren't listed on my manifest. I then have time to contact an agent to see if they are aware of it and it just hasn't showed up on my manifest yet. I strongly suggest all flight attendants be very aware of passengers using O2 and watch for the device when passengers are boarding; then verify we all know about it. None of that would have mattered in this instance as his O2 bottle was concealed in a small black oblong bag. Boarding an aircraft is a crazy busy time for all concerned. All the more reason to be alert then; as well as any time after takeoff; to things like a passengers using (what should only be) an O2 concentrator and checking to make sure they are listed in our manifest or the proper tag has been placed on it by our agents.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported discovering a lung cancer patient inhaling oxygen from a personal bottle not listed on the manifest.

We were using standard procedures for securing the cockpit during this operation. One flight attendant was stationed outside of a galley cart while the crews were leaving that cockpit to use the bathroom. Two pilots remained in the cockpit all this time. I was later informed; that a passenger was asked politely by that flight attendant to move away from the area he was standing. He was standing between the galley cart blocking access to the cockpit and the galley itself. The flight attendant felt that this was a security issue and informed him accordingly. The passenger is a frequent traveler with us and threatened to 'write up' the flight attendant for her asking him to go back to his seat for security reasons. The company has granted frequent travelers the power of supervising working crew members who have a critical safety function to perform on the aircraft. The company even encourages passengers to report on flight attendants performance by sending them emails after their flight asking about the flight itself. I think this is an inappropriate power to give to the passengers which causes pressure on the flight attendants to perform in a way that can be contrary to safety; in order to prevent being reported by a passenger. Passengers have no training whatsoever in our security procedures and it is inappropriate for them to be given this power over the flight attendants.

We were about 3.5 hours from our destination. The Chief Purser called the cockpit and advised me that we had an elderly passenger; flying with her granddaughter; experiencing some confusion. She advised me that the passenger has a history of dementia and that her granddaughter had also advised her of that Ms. X was experiencing some confusion and anxiety. She has some difficulty seeing (was told that she was somewhat blind but could see light and some shapes); in addition Ms. X didn't speak English. We found someone to interpret; but Ms. X was unresponsive; uncooperative and was unable to understand what was going on. I was flying; so I had the last break; so I (the Captain) went back to see what assistance I could offer. I found Ms. X agitated and not responding to verbal commands. I was advised that she wanted to open the door and get out; she kept telling the interpreter that she wanted to see her daughter 'right now' (the daughter was waiting for Ms. X to connect to another flight; and was going to pick her up). I observed her trying to go for the door; and she became somewhat combative; in addition she began to 'chant' out loud. I talked to the Doctor and Nurse who had offered to help and asked their advice. It was decided that we would let her stand in the aisle way and try and tire herself out (she refused any liquids or medication). I requested an F/A to remain at the door. I didn't want to force her to sit down; and I didn't want to have to restrain her; due to her frail stature and age. I had requested the two pilots in the cockpit to contact Dispatch and advise them of the situation; and our desire to have medical meet the airplane. I discussed the option of diverting with the Doctor and the Nurse; they thought that she could be managed; and that they would keep an eye on her. I elected to continue the flight. I ordered the cabin lights to be turned on in the hope that she would feel a little more secure. I returned to my seat and tried to resume my break. A few minutes later I was advised that she was becoming agitated and aggressive again. I returned to the cabin and after a discussion with the Doctor and Nurse; I ordered her to be put in an aisle with three seats so that the Nurse could sit on one side and the interpreter could sit on the other and keep her secure. It should be noted that by this time she had become a little more familiar with them and was responding somewhat to their voices. She did not want to sit down; so we had to hold her hands down while we physically put her in the seat. This was done with the help of myself; the Doctor; the Nurse; her granddaughter and another F/A. We got her into the seat and buckled her in; while the Nurse and Translator positioned themselves on either side of her. Ms. X calmed down; but did experience a few more episodes of agitation and aggressive behavior. I again questioned them of their ability to keep her calm. If the situation continued; or got worse; I was going to divert and get her off the airplane. They assured me that they could handle her; and there was no further incident for the rest of the trip. When we arrived; the Paramedics were standing by and had to restrain her to get her out of the jet. We thanked all who were involved; and told them how much we appreciated their assistance and consideration. I elected not to call for a Security level 1 or 2; after discussing it with the crew. Ms. X was clearly confused and suffering from Dementia; I did not feel she was a threat to the flight; only to herself. Her agitation and aggressiveness appeared to be due to her confusion and fear; I witnessed no malice or desire for violence. Because of her advance age and frail stature; I saw no real or immediate threat.

I requested that ground put us on another ramp which they said they didn't have. Ground kept moving us around the airfield. A couple of PAs were made by the number 1 requesting the person with the FAA banned device identify themselves by ringing their Flight Attendant (FA) call button. The flight attendants got no response. I read the pilot alert messages to the number 1 FA stating; 'if a NOTE 7 is discovered after gate departure the FAs will instruct the passenger to disconnect the device from any charging source; turn the device off; and keep it in a place where constant visual monitoring can be accomplished.' There is no requirement to return to the gate if a NOTE 7 is discovered on board as long as the passenger complies with instructions. The passenger would not identify themselves even after I made a PA.I notified dispatch as I could not determine if the phone was in the cabin or cargo. Dispatch told me to return to the gate to get the issue resolved. I also needed fuel after the delay back up to release fuel. I told the passengers we were returning to the gate to have the aircraft searched for the Samsung phone.

I was told that there was a problem with passenger life vests. There were several seats missing life vests security seals; covers and seals or life vests. Maintenance said they didn't have time to fix 37 seats that maintenance; security and the flight attendants had identified with discrepancies. The life vests were written up in the logbook for corrective action by maintenance. After consultation with the flight attendants; we were not comfortable with the departure and arrival over water with approximately 37 life vests in the cabinet adjacent to the first class galley. [The MEL] (that maintenance was using); states; 'remove and stow the affected life vest with the broken or missing cover in the spare life vest kit.' The MEL procedure was not complied with correctly. The vests were individually stacked in a cabinet; adjacent to the galley; on top of the spare life vest kits. Due to the large number of life vests in the cabinet; a departure and arrival over large bodies of water and consultation with the flight attendants; I decided that safety was being compromised and talked to a maintenance manager for another solution to have the life vests readily accessible to the passengers. The maintenance manager wanted to return the life vests to their under seat pouches and secure them with tape or stickers. I agreed that would be the safest course of action due to the high number of seats involved. The intent of the MEL; I believe; is not to put 1/3 of the aircraft's life vests in an overhead cabinet so they are not readily accessible by the passengers in the event of a water landing shortly after takeoff or before landing during overwater operations. The MEL is talking about a life vest. The MEL does not address multiple; or 1/3 of the life vests; being placed in the spare life vest kits; as this would be physically impossible. The MEL is poorly written because maintenance interprets it to mean they could put every life vest; loose; in the front cabinet. Clearly; this is not the intent of the MEL or the FAA. The MEL does not identify a maximum number of life vests allowed to be out of position.[Airport] operations; Mr. A; came down from operations to the aircraft cockpit to try and get us to accept the poorly written MEL. Mr. A was only concerned with the delay the maintenance discrepancy was causing and tried to get us to take the incorrect interpretation of the MEL and unsatisfactory/incorrect placement of the life vests. He said this is a legal MEL and we need the gate. Mr. A came back to the cockpit after I made the decision to have the placement of the life vests returned to the 37 seats; as the maintenance manager had described; in the interest of passenger safety; after consultation with my crew and maintenance; and said you have 3 choices here Captain; 1) you can take the aircraft with the MEL (not complied with correctly); 2) have maintenance use the temporary securing procedure to put the life vests back under their seats which will take two hours to accomplish in a hangar (which I elected) or cancelling the flight. I chose option 2. The mechanics wanted to remove the aircraft off the gate; so the crew deplaned to the gate area. Mr. A was clearly upset with my decision; stating several aircraft had departed with the same problem; the same incorrect placement of loose vests in the cabinet and the same MEL. I told him that doesn't make the high number of inaccessible life vests; in a short notice situation; being crammed in a cabinet; correct or the safest course of action. Due to the high number of vests in the cabinet; it would be near impossible for the flight attendants to get those to passengers in a panicked cabin in the water. The placement of this many vests in a cabinet would hamper the safe evacuation of the aircraft on water. Once these passengers; without life vests; were in the water; even one mile offshore; their survival chances would be poor. I told Mr. A my decision stands on the maintenance corrective action discussed with the maintenance manager.The gate agents were taking comments from the passengers when I asked would you like me to make a PA. I announced to the passengers that we had a life vest problem due to the departure and arrival over water; and in the interest of safety the mechanics were replacing the life vests under the seats. Most people accepted my explanation. As I was departing the gate area; [a passenger] accosted me; yelling you need to apologize to all these passengers. I told him in a calm voice that I said what I needed to say. He continued with his loud rant yelling this is ridiculous and you need to apologize. I asked him his name; as I decided in his rage and temper; was not fit to fly on the aircraft. He refused to give me his name and said what is your name as I walked away with the FO. He chased me down the terminal; stepping in front of me; yelling what is your name. I returned to the gate; as I felt threatened when he impeded my movement in the terminal; as he chased me yelling like a mentally disturbed man; to call the police and have him removed from the flight. The police arrived at the gate and was briefed by the first officer and myself. We both identified ourselves as FFDOs (Federal Flight Deck Officers) to the police officer; although the FO was non-mission. The officer said the unstable; belligerent passenger was gone from our gate area and would be no further trouble. The passenger was subsequently rebooked on another flight; to my objection. I called operations and told them this passenger shouldn't be allowed on any flight due to his unstable; irritated; explosive behavior. I called the Captain of the other flight and briefed him on the belligerent passenger and told him he had been removed from my flight due to his threatening behavior; and the company put him on his flight. We were given another aircraft by operations and departed with a delay of 3+51.",,,,"A321 Captain reported a long flight delay due to missing life vest security seals and disagreement over where the vests were to be stowed in compliance with the MEL.",

During my briefing of the exit row passengers the three men traveling together were a little boisterous. 8A told me he wasn't willing and able to assist. Then said he was after I told him I would relocate him. I think he was trying to be humorous. After we began to taxi out to the runway the passengers in 8A and 8B stood up. I started to reach for my phone to make a PA but then 8A started walking aft. I went back and asked what he was doing and he said 'I am going to [the bathroom]!' I asked if he could wait because we were going to be taking off very soon. He got louder and said 'No; I have to [go to the bathroom]. I am going to [the bathroom]'. It was at that point I became suspicious that he may be intoxicated. I asked him if he had been drinking. He said no but at the same time the passenger in 8D who was not traveling with them said 'yes!' Then he again stated that he was 'going to [the bathroom]' so I told him OK and that I would let the Captain know so we would stop taxi and wait.I looked at his friends and 8B said 'he isn't drunk'. 8C said 'he is just [a jerk]'. And 8B said 'he is a [jerk]. He is like this all the time'.I called the Captain (CA) and advised him of the situation. The CA told me we were going to be going into a 20-minute ground delay but that he would make a PA asking all to be seated. The man from 8A came out of the lavatory. The Captain made an announcement asking everybody to be seated. But the man from 8A continued to stand in the aisle in row 8.I again went back to row 8 and asked what was going on and he was very hostile and raised his voice and told me 'You need to know that if you EVER tell me I cannot [go to the bathroom] again; if you EVER tell me I can't then I will STAND UP! I will STAND UP for every  person on this airplane...'. I noticed this time he was slurring his words. By 'standing up' he meant stand up for himself and not physically stand up. I felt intimidated by his behavior and felt that he was threatening me. I was afraid that if I would have to ask him to buckle his seat belt or anything else that he might lose further control or 'stand up' so I walked away from them and went back forward. Keep in mind that I also never told him that he could not use the lavatory and that he did use it. I called the Captain and advised him I felt unsafe with this passenger and that he was threatening and slurring and did not think it was safe to continue with him onboard. We discussed it a bit as this was not a decision taken lightly. We went back to the gate and law enforcement came on along with two station personnel. The officer told the man to come with him so they could have a chat in the jet way. As the man was being escorted off one of the station personnel blocked me in the galley so I was not in view of the passenger. I could not hear the conversation in the jet way and the passenger was removed from the flight. We closed the door and taxied back out. During my beverage service passengers seated in 2D; 7C; 7D; 8D and 9D all told me that they were glad the passenger was removed. The passengers in 7C and 7D told me they were getting nervous with him sitting behind them. They said when I was up front he was saying a lot of things that made them uncomfortable.As we were deplaning; two more passengers stopped to tell the Captain and me that we handled the situation well and thanked us for not letting him continue on their flight. Finally the man who had been sitting [near] them told us that he saw all three of them drinking minis that they snuck onto the plane themselves but that the other two settled down after their companion was removed.The passengers who had been traveling with him were compliant with regulations during the flight and also apologized for their companion as they deplaned the aircraft.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"CRJ-200 Captain and Flight Attendant reported an intoxicated and belligerent passenger was removed from the flight when they returned to the gate.",

All crewmembers were in the aisle doing their service and I was the only one in the aft galley. I heard 3 short bell/chime sounds and felt I should investigate. I stood by the aft right lav and a passenger came out. I felt that the sound had came from the lav; so I asked the passenger if he had been smoking and he said that he had a vapor cigarette and that he had used it in the lav. I informed him that they were banned from being used on the airplane and that he cannot use them. I went into the lav and inspected all compartments to make sure the area was safe. I did not smell any odor nor did I find any evidence. I notified the purser of the situation. I am submitting this report due to the concern of function of the alarm. No one would have never known that the passenger had used a prohibited item on the plane if I had not been sitting on the jumpseat. No crewmember would ever be able to hear the weak alarm sound. If this item is prohibited; shouldn't the alarm be audible as to notify crew members that prohibited activity was occurring in the lavatory?

Passing ZZZZ I received a call from the back of the plane that a male had hit his head in the aft galley. Turns out he had mixed alcohol and Ambien; causing him to pass out in the galley. The flight attendants tried to help him; but he wanted to fight. While talking to dispatch and Medlink to see if there were any drugs to help him; his girlfriend with the same alcohol and Ambien; vomited in the aft galley. While all this is happening the two aft FAMS subdued the male from seat XXY. Turns out he had urinated in the seat; on the floor and in the aft galley. Being so far north and getting ready to coast out on the Atlantic crossing; Medlink thought it best we land short and have this person check[ed] by a hospital because of the head injury. Medlink check[ed] ZZZZ for services; then felt it best to go to ZZZ; was 1.5 hours away and ZZZ1 was 2.5 hours away.  Had this individual not hit his head we would have just continued on to ZZZZ1.With the help of dispatch we decided to divert to ZZZ. We had the third copilot come back to the cockpit to help with the diversion. Informed the passengers of what was happening. Ran the diversion checklist; fuel dump checklist; informed dispatch that when we land we were going to be fatigued and needed the plane crewed so that the passengers would be delayed as little as possible. This decision was not made lightly. We looked at the time we had been awake; the stressful situation and with diverting and the number of hours yet to fly with holding delays into ZZZZ1. After landing in gusty wind conditions we taxied to the gate where we were met by company personnel; police; and emergency personnel.

Cleaning crew had just gotten off for second time due to bringing us missing items for the aft lavs and I was going through overhead bin at 38DEF and also had OH (Overhead) bin at 38ABC and 39ABC opened. The male passenger tried to move past me and I asked him to please wait and that he could store his belongings in the OH bin around rows 36 or 37 as there was no room because those bins in 38 and 39 were full with emergency equipment; and supplies and crew luggage. He then tried to pass by me; again and I asked him to please wait. At this time; my flying partner was dealing with the caterers; door 2L was opened; there was no toilet paper in the lavs and I needed to lock the OH bin at 38ABC. The male passenger then asked me 'Who do you work for?' I found this question strange but I answered him. He then told me I should not be working for them; he did not like my face and said '[expletive] you' to me. I was flabbergasted; I did not know if I heard him correctly and then said 'Excuse me; what did you say?' and he said 'I don't like your attitude; you're mean so [expletive] you'! I told the passenger' do not use that language with me or onboard this plane ever again'. Then he took out his cell phone; said I was making his wife hold his baby too long and he proceeded to take out his cell phone took my picture or either started videotaping me with his cell phone. I told him to put the cell phone off of camera mode because I did not authorize him to take my picture. He told me he could do whatever he wanted. My flying partner then intervened and told him to stop with the camera as it was illegal to do that and he would call the Captain. The male passenger became more flippant and sat down. He kept looking in the OH bins at 38 and 39 as if we were not telling him the truth about OH bin storage. Why he tried to go that far back is unbeknownst to me because he was the first person on the plane and there was room for his big bag and overstuffed back pack. He then tried to engage other passengers in his rant and rave about me and towards me and then I got a call from the Purser. I relayed to the Purser what had happened and that I felt threatened by the passenger's behavior and foul colorful language. Plus the fact that he swore like that; with his baby present and specifically said he didn't like my face! He taunted me and asked me for my name so I told him [title and first initial]. He then said; 'No; give me your real name!' At that point; I was called up to the FC (First Class) cabin to meet with the customer service agent. He asked me what happened and I told him what seat the passengers were in and he already knew who I was referencing because he had issues with [this passengers] aggressiveness out in the gate area. I then realized as I walked back to the back of the cabin that he was the same passenger who almost hit me in the face with his big black oversized bag and big backpack out in the gate area because he came into the flight attendant seating area and was bumping into my luggage with his oversized bag as I sat in the chair at the gate. The male Customer Service agent told me he had spoken with our Captain who advised the CSR (Customer Service Representative) to remove the male passenger from the aircraft.

He raised his voice; yelling at me about not being allowed to use the restroom right then. I had to tell him several times to sit down and he just kept standing over me and arguing with me. It was very upsetting and I could feel an adrenaline rush. An hour later I was still shaky and then started feeling nauseous just before we started our final beverage service. I then threw up several times which triggered an asthma attack. The C Flight Attendant (FA) got a Portable Oxygen Bottles (POB) for me to use. Medlink was contacted and they advised getting the albuteral inhaler from the Enhanced Emergency Medical Kit (EEMK). Even though I had already found my Xopenex inhaler and used it they said to use that one since mine might not be effective since it might not be up to date. The abuteral inhaler caused me to shake uncontrollably and feel faint. So they paged for a doctor; he was an orthopedic surgeon who said there may have also been a drop in my blood pressure which was causing me to feel faint. So the paramedics were contacted and asked to meet the flight. After we blocked in before the passengers deplaned the paramedics removed me from the plane. After checking my vitals and hearing what happened they said I could go home since my husband was picking me up. And if I felt like I needed to I could go to the ER or clinic. I should have been much more assertive with the passenger who refused to listen to me and just commanded that he immediately sit down or we would have the police meet our flight to deal with him. Basically what he did was assault. He yelled loud enough at me for our captain to hear him from the locked bathroom. I never should have allowed it to escalate to that point by trying to be nice. I should have yelled loud enough for the other FAs to hear me in the back of the plane since I did not feel safe to turn my back on him to get to the intercom as they were finishing their service. I did not know if this was a plot to try to take over our aircraft or test our responses or if he was just drunk and disorderly. He towered over me and got in my face to yell at me.

I informed him that it was in use by one of the pilots; and asked if he could take his seat so I could do my count and I'd let him know as soon as it was open. He snapped only if you want a wet spot on your seat. I noticed that he had a joint or something similar hanging out of his hat; and he smelled strongly of weed. I did my count and as I reached his seat at row 12; the lav became available. I told him it was open; and went back to the B Flight Attendant (FA) and informed them of my interactions; and FA B told me he had a similar interaction. I told him I thought pax appeared to be under the influence of drugs. I went forward and filled in the Captain (CA); and asked the gate agent if she had any similar interactions with pax. She said no; he went through TSA; and she had spoken to him a few times; and didn't know why I was concerned. FA B came forward and we both talked with the CA; who got out of his seat and stood by the male pax to observe him. FA B was comfortable and said he was ok if pax stayed on board; CA agreed. I was on the fence leaning towards removal. I didn't know if the altitude would affect him being under the influence of weed; like it would if he had been under the influence of alcohol. CA reassured me it would not affect him like that. We all agreed he could stay. We closed the door; and did our safety demo. As I was checking compliance; I noticed same pax was not buckled; I asked him now three different times; and his phone was still not in airplane mode. We were on taxi. I went back to FA B; and said it's now your turn to try to get him to comply with the seatbelt and phone. FA B went up to the pax and asked if he was buckled and if phone was in airplane mode. I am not sure of the exact conversation as I was in the galley watching; and waiting. All of the sudden the First Officer made his 'FAs prepare the cabin' announcement and FA B came to the back and said we are returning the gate. He is off. He filled me in that pax was not complying and was starting to argue; and informed FA B that he had 'pre-funked' with weed before the flight. We called the flight deck and told them to return to gate; asked for pax to be removed; and asked for Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) to meet us. We got to the gate; and two LEOs and an agent came onboard. We filled them in; and told LEO his seat number. LEO told him he was off; and told him to gather his stuff. They came forward; LEO asked where we flew in from; before I could respond pax said nowhere. After she got him off; she asked how much weed he had on him; he told her he had his medical card and could carry as much as he wanted. As we were talking to other LEO; the lady sitting next to male pax brought up his left-behind joint; she gave it to LEO. We told the LEO that he wouldn't comply; and that he was arguing with us. He said ok. We also told the [supervisor] about the gate agent and how we had told her about our concerns and how she didn't understand why we were concerned.

After receiving clearance from approach for the visual into ZZZ was informed by the dispatcher via ACARS that the airport ops was reporting a NOTAM of a FICON (Field Conditions) of ice (Tower is Closed at this point in time airport is uncontrolled). Upon receiving this information myself along with the first officer and dispatcher concluded that a diversion was the best course of action at that point in time until we could get some better information on the conditions at ZZZ airport. Diversion went as planned no issues. Once parked and at the gate; I called the dispatcher to see if we couldn't figure out a course of action. We discussed a couple of things as he was in direct contact with the ZZZ operations. Eventually we were informed that the landing runway had been treated and the NOTAM of 1/1/1 had been removed and the airport was reporting a FICON of 5/5/5 braking action good. We decided that based upon this information there was no reason that we could not proceed to ZZZ. We re boarded the airplane and proceeded on our way to ZZZ.The departure; enroute flight and approach were uneventful. After landing is when I noticed that we as a crew and the dispatcher had been misinformed. The runway was covered with ice and the braking action was very poor almost nil in some areas. I was able to eventually bring the airplane to a complete stop using brakes; and thrust reversers. We were able to gingerly taxi the airplane off of the landing runway onto the intersecting runway where we further started to slide about and ability to maintain aircraft control was almost impossible. We brought the aircraft to a complete stop again on the runway in a last effort to further taxi to the terminal we tried to turn north onto a taxiway and began to slide again uncontrollably eventually leading the aircraft almost doing a 180 with the tail facing north. We were able to get the airplane to stop on the taxiway now partially on the taxiway facing south with the airplane's nose touching runway. After this we decided that further trying to taxi would not be a safe option so we shut down the engines and contacted operations as to our situation. Stranded on our own for roughly an hour and a half we tried to come up with a plan while talking to the airport operations to which were pretty much left stranded on our own. The only help we received was a lone fireman that was able to help us deplane the passengers 2 to 3 at a time while making runs from the airplane to the terminal.Late night; we were misinformed to the true state of the airport in ZZZ the airport was pretty much one huge sheet of ice. Airport ops was no help as the airplane was unable to taxi as well as stuck on a taxiway about half a mile from the airport terminal. Overall this is a huge learning experience on so many levels. I guess what bothers me the most is that in this situation there was a feeling of helplessness and frustration not with the company or the crew; but with the ZZZ facility and the information given to us prior to flying there and once on the ground. Honestly it's going to be hard for me to trust this station or anything associated with it from now on. All of this could have been avoided if people were honest.",,"We asked the station operations if they had transportation available to pick them up at the airplane and take them to the terminal; they stated they had none. We then had them get ahold of the local sheriff and fire departments to ask them for assistance; which he said he would do; in addition to calling the airport manager to ask him for any other options. Two hours went by before we had anyone show up at our aircraft for assistance. It was one gentleman driving a pickup truck from the fire department. We decided to take advantage of his assistance; and started to deplane the passengers beginning with the elderly followed by families with their children; then the most irritated/outspoken. Some of the passengers were becoming very unruly during this time; and threatened to walk off the aircraft and walk. We were able to appease them long enough to allow the fire department to assist them to the terminal. One particular passenger saw the truck driver pull up to the aircraft and yelled 'I'm getting off this airplane right now;' and pushed his way out of the airplane and walked down to the truck. Another truck driver pulled up after we had offloaded about half of the 45 passengers to assist. It took us approximately an hour and a half to finish deplaning everyone.In the meantime; the station had been treating the taxiway with an ice removal chemical; as they wanted us to finish taxiing to the gate. There was still patchy ice in several areas; so we decided to leave the plane where it was overnight. The station and our company wanted us to wait for a few hours to allow the rest of the taxiway to be cleared to accomplish this final portion of the taxi; but we discussed our level of fatigue between us two pilots and determined we were too exhausted to continue crew duty. We called in fatigue at this point; and finally got to our hotel at approximately 7:30 in the morning. There was no damage to the aircraft during this entire ordeal; and the airplane never left any portion of the prepared surface. In addition; no passenger was injured during the entire evening.

We called the flight attendants and (in accordance with standard operating procedures) the FO stepped out of the cockpit and a FA came in; closing the cockpit door behind him. While the FO was in the lavatory; a female passenger came up to the forward galley. The FA informed her that she must use one of the lavatories in the back of the aircraft or return to her seat; but that she could not remain in the forward galley. The passenger was Hispanic and claimed not to understand the FA. Luckily; all three of the FAs spoke fluent Spanish and it was again explained in Spanish. The passenger still refused to move and she verbally abused and threatened the FAs. A deadheading male FA came up to assist. The 'A' FA called up to inform me what was going on. I could hear loud voices over the interphone and the FAs speaking to the passenger in Spanish. Meanwhile; the FO had exited the lavatory and was now also in the galley. After several more minutes; the passenger's husband came up and convinced her to return to her seat. After she was seated and with the three FAs plus the male deadheading FA guarding and blocking access to the forward galley and the cockpit door; the cockpit door was opened and the FA exited the cockpit and the FO entered. We then locked down the cockpit in accordance with a Threat Level 1. I contacted Dispatch with our status and requested to have law enforcement meet the aircraft in ZZZ. After arriving in ZZZ; law enforcement removed the passenger from the aircraft.After speaking with the FO over the interphone; and visually confirming the galley was secure; I determined that it was safer and more prudent to have the FO in the cockpit for the remainder of the flight. This scenario needs to be addressed during recurrent security training. What is the safest course of action if the cockpit is locked down with one of the pilots in the cabin? If it is determined that keeping the cockpit on lockdown is the safest course; where should the FA sit? In the jumpseat or in a pilot seat?","The reporter stated that this encounter with a passenger was more of a misunderstanding; but it brought up the bigger issue of what to do if the threat is real. If a real threat was just outside the cockpit door with the first officer out of the cockpit with a single pilot and flight attendant in the cockpit; what is the proper procedure? Do you put the FA in the pilot's seat where they have access to the flight controls; but you can keep an eye on him/her? Do you put the FA in the jumpseat where you can't see them? The reporter mused 'could the FA be in on it'; what is really happening on the other side of the door? The reporter stated that he feels unprepared for which procedure should the pilot use for these type of scenarios. He feels more training should occur addressing these issues.",,,"B737-800 Captain reported that a passenger refused to leave the forward galley while the First Officer was using the forward lavatory causing a security issue.",

Due to herself being hit physically as well as a second Flight Attendant (FA) it took four flight attendants to subdue and restrain a now flex cuffed female passenger. The [relief pilot] was on break in the bunk. Ultimately a divert was initiated after inquiry with flight desk and the [Duty Manager]  after the [relief pilot] was woke and on the flight deck the cockpit was locked down.Although; national police were requested to meet the aircraft in SBBR an emergency was not declared; and ATC was very difficult to communicate the decision to divert was made.Similarly; we needed to dump fuel to get down to landing weight for SBBR; we did jettison fuel without ATC engaged.More efficient communications would have resolved a very high work load; although multiple requests and discussions were had with dispatch the support and shared decision making was minimal; as a flight crew engaging our resources; we needed better support so we could focus on items like referring to flight manuals for guidance on jettisoning fuel; instead we had to call on the satellite phone multiple times to dispatch; we were having difficulty ascertaining what to expect after landing from [company] personnel at the station; we never did get an affirmative response from [company] that the 'National Police' per our manuals would be standing by; or that station personnel would be available let alone a mechanic to do an overweight inspection. I had very clearly requested these items over the satcom from dispatch but; a crew shift change occurred and no follow-up by [company] ops personnel came. This served to greatly increase the workload on the flight crew and in point of time available to land it limited the number of tasks that could be prioritized in the time available to prepare a divert in Brazilian airspace.Apparently; the dispatcher change took place and at one point the new dispatcher indicated it was known we were diverting to SBGR; when in fact we were descending to SBBR; we had told the previous dispatcher we were going to SBBR because; he had told us SBEG did not have [the right] service equipment; we had also; updated the FMS to reflect our turn to SBBR. The lack of anything meaningful from communications to [company] made our jobs significantly more task saturated. Due to the entire country of Brasil needing to communicate through SBGR ops and no way to call to SBBR ops effectively; we were truly in the blind as to what to plan for in SBBR; this impacted a decision to jettison fuel and could be immediately remedied by adding an ops frequency at our regular and alternate airports.The Brazilian radio quality and reliability added to our workload and at one point we lost the controller communications and had to scrabble a frequency that had been used previously at about the time we passed SBBR northbound before diverting into SBBR; this occurred minutes into our descent; this too impacted time to communicate; in the future I would request the company work through the channels available to make known our needs.We did ask for some items to be addressed by [company] personnel but; they did not get back to us in a supportive manner.At the outset of the event the captain and I both would have had better situational awareness had we known more thoroughly what was taking place in the cabin; I would suggest that when a physical altercation takes place; another non-abused crew member contact the flight deck; our purser had been assaulted and had experienced a disturbing event; she and the crew did an excellent job establishing a cabin that had order.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported a Flight Attendant was injured during a passenger altercation in the cabin.

The Flight Attendant B was on the phone relaying info to the Captain (CA); I was monitoring tower as we were awaiting takeoff clearance and was not in on this phone conversation. I asked the CA if he wanted me to get clearance to clear the runway; he said no; stay on the runway and see how long it takes to get our takeoff clearance. Our takeoff clearance came quickly from the tower and the CA said that we were going; and pushed the throttles up for takeoff. We found out later inflight that the passenger in question and 2 (or 3) Flight Attendants were standing in the cabin during takeoff.

After takeoff; the flight attendant notified me that they were in the aisle still standing when the takeoff was initiated.

I believe that the fact that the Flight Attendant B was on the phone relaying the message that the communication may have been confused or omitted.

She relayed a story of verbal abuse to her by one of our passengers. I asked that the passenger be paged to the front of the aircraft. I wanted to visit with him about his actions away from earshot of the other passengers. I also wanted to assess his willingness to comply with the flight crew going forward. Two PAs were made asking him by name to come forward. He did not respond or comply. Now that he has been abusive and non-compliant I went back to his seat to inform him I needed him to step off of the aircraft. With some protest he finally did.In the jetbridge he was contrite; apologetic; and soft spoken. He related that his father was on his deathbed and that he was upset and trying to get to [destination] in time to see him. I told [him] to wait a moment while I conferred with my crew. Flight Attendant Number 1 was in the front galley. As I approached her she immediately related that; while I was counseling [the passenger]; his sister in [seat next to him] had come up and spoken offensively to her. The Flight Attendant tried to reassure her that the Captain was working things out and to return to her seat. She would not; but only grew more obstinate. The Flight Attendant told her 4 times to return to her seat but she would not listen. Upon hearing this I decided that neither one could ride on our flight. They both failed to follow crew directions and had used abusive language toward the agent and Flight Attendant. Following in this pattern; they also refused to leave the aircraft until an [airport] police officer arrived on the scene.What sparked the exchange was the agent requiring the male passenger to put his rollaboard bag in the bag sizer. He reacted in anger and initially refused. He finally gave in but roughly shoved his bag in and called the agent a degrading name. When the agent relayed this to me later she was trembling. I think we can all sympathize with a passenger racing to be near a dying family member. But the reason for their travel does not justify the behavior. It may be that efforts to diffuse the behavior were not successfully deployed. Also; it would have been better to deny boarding than to remove him after the fact.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported the removal of two passengers who used abusive language toward the flight attendants and a Gate Agent during boarding.",

I was working in A position on the aircraft; a sold out flight with two jump seats occupied. A pre-boarding Customer was listed on my specials report as having a vision impairment and having a working assistance animal. I met the Customer in the jetbridge and offered my assistance; to which he refused. The Customer's service animal appeared to be a full sized golden lab.The Customer proceeded to sit in a bulkhead row aisle seat on this aircraft. I informed the Customer that he would need to sit in the window seat so that his service animal would not hinder the egress of Customers sitting outboard of him. The Customer informed me that he was not going to move to the window seat; that he knew his rights and that he had every right to sit in the aisle seat and that he didn't have to occupy the window seat if he didn't want too. He informed me that his dog was not going to be in the aisle and would not obstruct the aisle. I explained to him that the aisle was not my greatest concern; that the animal was in fact obstructing access to the aisle for the two yet to be occupied seats. The Customer still refused to move. Sensing that the customer was going to be difficult to deal with; I simply replied with; 'Ok' and continued with the boarding process.I pulled out my EFAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and conducted a search to make sure that I was in-line with [Company] policies and procedures. I also asked assistance from my B to help with the search so I could face my customers as they boarded the aircraft. Our search quickly found what we were looking for. [In the FAM] it stipulates that an assistance animal 'May not obstruct an aisle or access to an aisle.'  I informed a ramp agent in the jetbridge that I would need a representative to address the situation and they informed my Ops Agent. I informed my Captain of the situation.Boarding was complete and I still didn't have a representative. Ops Agent again called and Ops Supervisor came to assist. I explained the situation to Ops Sup and Captain and showed them the aforementioned FAM requirements for assistance animals. Captain reviewed the FAM for several minutes to ensure there was no grey area around the policies and procedures. We as a team; all 4 Flight Attendants; our Captain; our Ops Agent and our Ops Supervisor all found ourselves in agreement that the Customer with the assistance animal would need to sit in the window seat in order to meet our safety regulations. Ops Sup was tasked with engaging the Customer with the assistance animal and asking him to swap seats to the window seat. Ops Sup explained everything to the Customer and was rejected just as I was; but this time with all the seats full of Customers; Ops Sup found himself at the end of the stick. Customers who had no reason to be engaged in the conversation with Ops Sup found themselves yelling at Ops Sup; telling him that the disabled Customer had rights and that he didn't have to move if he didn't want too. Ops Sup left the aircraft and made a call to Customer Service to get their stance on the conflict. They backed the direction of the FAM and crew and directed Ops Sup to again ask the Customer with the assistance animal to move one last time or to remove him from the flight for non-compliance with safety regulations. Again; Ops Sup engaged the Customer and the Customer refused to move. He even said that he wasn't getting off the aircraft; period. With that Ops Sup was left with only one option; to call the police and have the Customer physical removed from the aircraft for his refusal to comply with the required safety regulations. After 10 minutes of waiting for the police; Ops Sup called the police again as they still hadn't shown up. The Customers in the row tried repeatedly to get the Customer with the assistance animal to move to the window seat but he refused. Everyonejust wanted to get the flight under way.After nearly 30 minutes the Customer with the assistance animal finally agreed to take the window seat; at the convincing of the Customers in his row. He was angry and told everyone that this was going to be their last day on the job. He stated that he wasn't going to leave the [arrival] airport until he had received justice for the injustices against him. The police never showed up. During the flight the Customer showed no aggression and other than using the forward lavatory three times; stayed in the window seat. He had a Jack and Coke which I comped. Upon arrival; the Ops Agent approached me regarding a known difficult Customer. I gave him the rundown of what happened so that he could alert his leadership team. The Customer and his supporters did in fact give the Customer Service and Ops team a difficult time in the gate area. Leadership informed the Customer that he needed to get in touch with Customer Service.Customers need to abide by the required safety regulations; including Customers with disabilities. Maybe the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act) could assist the airlines and their members by informing their members of what they can do to avoid conflict on an aircraft and how follow the safety regulations that airlines must enforce. As for flight crews; everyone must be on the same page in enforcing the safety regulations. When one crew lets safety slide; the rest of us hear about it from the Customers.",,,,"B737 Flight Attendant reported an encounter with a visually handicapped; dog-assisted passenger who refused a window seat thus failing to comply with company aisle obstruction regulations.

After completing the safety demo and taxiing to the runway; it was brought to my attention by my fellow FA that there were three women in the back of the aircraft who were loudly conversing about consuming edibles (marijuana). They then proceeded to pass around a bag of such edibles and offer them to the passengers around them; meanwhile loudly conversing about how 'messed up' they're going to get. According to both my other flight attendants; they were eagerly asking for alcohol on the ground and were angry when we had to decline. We could all smell alcohol on them already; and were uncomfortable with their eagerness to get a drink immediately; in addition to whatever drugs they were passing around. All 3 of us received an attitude when asking them to comply to simple safety rules such as fastening seat belts; being seated during taxi; and being in airplane mode (one was FaceTiming during taxi). At this point I informed the Captain; and he made the decision to go back to the gate where cops removed the women from the flight. FA had to specifically point out the passengers to the police; and the gate agent in ZZZ informed me that the passengers removed were angry with us and asked for our names. We then had to refuel and eventually closed back up and departed. Once in flight; I had the passenger in 2E approach me in the galley informing me he was a Federal Air Marshal; (of which I was not informed) and that he even noticed visible signs of intoxication as one woman even engaged him by the gate prior to the flight. Other passengers commented on signs of intoxication and the scent of marijuana as well. When we landed we were notified that our schedules had been reassigned to work a flight. After a long sit; we boarded our second flight with no pilots as they were arriving late. As I was distributing pre-departure beverages; I saw one of the previous females we had removed from our original flight board the plane. Perplexed as to how they managed to be cleared in ZZZ; I was instantly alarmed and informed my other flight attendants to get confirmation. Eventually our pilots arrived and we informed the Captain of our situation. All three of us felt extremely uncomfortable transporting these women who we had removed from a previous flight hours earlier. The women did not engage us or were necessarily acting belligerent; however they still smelled like alcohol. The gate agent in ZZZ also commented that he smelled alcohol on them however did not personally find them unfit to fly. The Captain told us that he would bring the women aside and talk to them need be. We felt uncomfortable and unsafe to fly with these passengers who clearly exhibited signs of intoxication to us in ZZZ; and who still currently smelled of alcohol. We were also uncomfortable with the fact that we were the crew that had already removed them from a previous flight; and were unsure of their demeanor towards us. The Captain responded by telling us these women were cleared by police at our departure airport to fly; so if we were uncomfortable working the flight he supported us if we did not want to continue. He then contacted a CSR supervisor in our next destination to come talk to us as well as Inflight supervisor. We stated our severe discomfort in traveling with these passengers who were visibly and audibly under the influence hours prior. We were told that we could of course decline the flight; but that there was no promise that there would not be disciplinary action if we chose that route. Feeling pressured to make an immediate decision with the potential of disciplinary action; we reluctantly agreed to work the flight despite the feeling that our safety could be compromised by transporting these intoxicated passengers we had previously made a judgment call on hours prior. I felt that an unnecessary safety risk was created by having the same crew transport the same women we deemed unfit to fly within the same day. Fortunately there was no confrontation during the quick flight and we did not have to engage in any confrontation with the women. However; it is unsettling that the discretion of an entire Flight Crew was so quickly dismissed; allowing these passengers to be instantly rebooked and present on a flight within hours; with the same crew.",,,,"A Flight Attendant reported several boisterous; non conforming passengers boarded their flight and were determined to be under the influence of marijuana but were removed after a gate return.

I told her that the dog needed to be in the carrier under the seat. She said that she would before we took off. I told her that now would be the time and waited for her to do it. She told me that I did not need to wait and I said 'as a flight attendant; you know that I do. I am performing my safety checks and need to make sure that everyone is in compliance.' She then got upset and said 'just wait until I come up there later and have a word with you.' I felt as though she was trying to intimidate me and so I asked her if she was threatening me. She laughed and asked me 'do you really want to do this?' I again took this as intimidation and asked her if she wanted to go back to the gate. She laughed and then put the dog in the carrier. I finished my checks and then went to the front and looked up her name on the tablet. I noticed that the passenger sitting in her seat had a paid ticket so to confirm who she was I went back to her and asked for her ID. She did not show me her ID but instead wrote her name and employee number on a sick bag and gave it to me while stating 'go ahead and call the office. They all know who I am.' I felt this was another way to intimidate me. The dog was in the carrier so I went to my seat in the hopes that she would calm down.During the flight I spoke with my captain about the situation and we both agreed that we would wait to see if she gave us any more problems before we took further action. At the end of the flight while I was doing my safety checks before landing I noticed that the dog was again out of the carrier but she was putting him back in it. Once we got to the gate the captain came out of the flight deck as soon as possible to witness if there were any further problems with the flight attendant. The flight attendant then deplaned with the dog out of the carrier on a leash. The captain said that he was going to go talk to her about her actions and followed her off the plane. I did not hear anything else so I figured that the situation was being taken care of. Last week I was asked to come into the office to speak with my Manager. She stated that she received a complaint letter from [the Flight Attendant in question] stating that I was rude and did not handle the situation properly. I was told by my Manager that I should have never waited to make sure that she put the dog in the carrier and that my job is not to 'enforce' FAA regulations but only to 'inform'. She stated that I should have told her to put the dog away only a couple of times and then let her be. She stated that the flight attendant was trying to calm her dog down because he had anxiety about flying. When I told her that [the Flight Attendant in question] tried to intimidate me she responded by defending [the Flight Attendant in question] by saying that the dog was a rescue dog and had special needs and that I should have spoken to [the Flight Attendant in question] about the dog when she got on the plane.I need some guidance because now I'm confused about my place in my job. I cannot find anywhere in the manual that states that a dog who is not a service animal can remain out of the carrier for any reason. It is also my understanding that passengers must be in compliance at all times and should not argue or intimate a flight attendant under any circumstance. What should I have done in this situation? As a flight attendant are we just supposed to inform the passengers about the rules and then let them be? Please help me understand this situation better.",,,,"B737 Flight Attendant reported having to instruct an off duty Flight Attendant in uniform; to keep her small dog in its carrier prior to and after the flight.",

Later I was told by other crew members that she had changed his diaper on the passenger seat. He was unable to stand or even move himself to a sitting position from laying on the seat. She was unable to move him or help him in the bathroom.This seems an unsafe condition for him to be unable to use a bathroom for a 15 hour flight. It seems unsanitary to change a diaper in the passenger seat. It seems unsanitary and unfair to have other passengers have to share the area with the smells of human urine and feces for such a long flight.In hind sight I wish we had contacted [customer service] during boarding to determine if it was acceptable for him to travel. He needed one or two or more strong people traveling with him to be able to get him in the aisle chair and help him in the bathroom.

They both explained he could purchase wine in the air and both gave him water. During the service; he asked one of them for wine. She saw he had cash and told him we accepted debit and credit only. Passenger became aggressive. Passenger then stood up and starting asking people to pay for him. I told him he needed to sit down. Passenger became argumentative. He demanded wine; I tell him no and he needs to lower his voice. Passenger then says he wants to talk to the (expletive) captain and he wants to know who the director of the airline is. I tell him I am the lead flight attendant on this flight. He is cussing and raising his voice and tells me he will pay me one million dollars for wine. No one serves him any alcohol. I go to the front and call the captain and inform him of what is happening. Captain declares threat level 1 and asks to monitor situation. Passenger in seat XXC is a woman. She comes to the front galley and asks if she can stay up here for a minute as she is uncomfortable. I tell her yes. I then see passenger in XXA has moved seats and is crying.

He also offered his help. He and another gentlemen moved to the seats next to the problem passenger as we were full and the two women did not feel comfortable sitting next to him. He boarded the plane with a boxing helmet on. He had this helmet as well as boxing gloves with him at his seat. He was taking pictures of us and filming the entire interaction during the flight. I kept the captain informed. Law enforcement met the airplane. We deplaned normally. Supervisor met the airplane as well. I am concerned that it is a rule that passengers cannot video tape or take photos of the flight attendants however it seems hard to enforce. With social media being the way it is today; it makes me uncomfortable that my face may be on his phone videos. As flight attendants are we allowed to tell them to delete the material? Or do we just advise them that it is against the rules to film us? I would like guidance on this issue so that if it were to happen again in the future; I would understand the best approach.

The officer advised me that he needed to debrief the F/A now because he could not detain these people without a reason. I advised the officer if he could wait until the deplaning was completed because she was required to stay on the aircraft until all passengers were off.

Several passengers non-compliant; sitting in areas of the aircraft where they had not paid for that seat; such as economy passengers taking first class seats; when they had paid for and were assigned economy seats. We had passenger in 25B take seat 9C; which is $179 more; but she would not take her assigned seat until our purser; Mr. X; instructed her to do so. Upon landing and still on an active taxiway; this passenger moved again from seat 25B to 9C; as 50 people stood up to retrieve their bags from the overhead bins and place them in the aisles. Our aircraft had stopped on the taxiway to allow other aircraft right of way. We made several announcements and yet no one would heed the announcement to replace their bags in the overhead bins; and take a seat and buckle up.Passenger in 9E pretended to be asleep and we could not wake her to take her economy seat; I am not sure where that was; but our purser had tried several times to have her move. She woke up after we walked away and then went back to sleep whenever we approached her.Mr. X declared a Level 1 threat as it was almost chaotic; no one would listen to us. The general feeling was that passengers felt they could do whatever they wanted.The cockpit called for security; but when we arrived at the gate; we were greeted by one customer service agent; and no one else. Mr. X was approached by passengers in the Customs Hall as they wanted his name and they had their cell phones out; including the passenger who was seated in 25B and took 9C without paying the up-charge.Passenger in 14D; kept changing seats as well; although he stayed within his 'area'; he drank 2 vodkas and had asked for more; but decided not to have any more vodka. This took our time throughout the flight; rarely did we have time to take care of those customers who simply wanted service and to sleep. We had such disruptive passengers in 25B/9C; 9E; and row 14; most notably 14D.

Just before landing the lavatory door behind me opens and a passenger is there. I told him to stay in the lavatory for landing; because he couldn't get back to his seat before landing; hold onto the assist handle and brace himself.

I received instructions to fly direct [to a fix] for the RNAV RWY 2 into [the airport]. At that point; I could see passenger; Mr. X (who was sitting directly behind me) start leaning over to his right and looking at the GPS. He started to talk and say where he thought [the airport] was and start pointing towards it. I flew the RNAV RWY 2 approach to minimums and could not see the runway; I executed the published missed approach. It appears there was a fog bank sitting right over the approach end of runway 2. I thought the fog would dissipate; therefore; I decided to set up for RNAV RWY 2 approach again. As I was executing the missed approach; Mr. X starts yelling again; and telling me where he thought [the airport] was and that he could see the runway. I flew back; executed published hold; and got clearance for RNAV RWY 2 approach again. Meanwhile; Mr. X is talking the whole time. I fly the whole RWY 2 approach to minimums again; and same thing; I could not see the runway at minimums. However; as soon as I flew over the approach end of runway 20; I could see the runway. I executed the published missed approach procedure again. As I am climbing to altitude; Mr. X starts yelling more saying 'hey pilot; [the airport] is over there' and points to it.He also keeps saying 'young pilot is too scared to fly into fog and doesn't want to land.' He then starts tapping me on my shoulder violently and starts yelling. At this point; I had to turn around and tell him to cut it out. As I am climbing up to altitude; I decided I needed this passenger off of the airplane. I keep climbing up to published missed approach altitude (1900 ft). I was severely distracted by Mr. X; who was interfering with my duties at a critical phase of flight. I then instructed the controller that I wanted to get clearance for the RNAV RWY 20 as it appeared on my last missed approach that the approach into runway 20 would work better. I received clearance to climb to 3000 ft. The controller also advised me to contact a number when I got on the ground. I was thinking to myself; I had no idea what I did wrong; if anything. I flew direct [to the assigned fix] and was instructed to climb an additional 100 ft; to 3100 ft until crossing [the fix] and received approach clearance.I believed requesting the RNAV 20 and flying a third approach was the best course of action; first off; because I needed this passenger off of the airplane and did not feel comfortable flying 60 minutes back to [our departure airport] with him on board; and secondly; the fog seemed to just be at the approach end of RWY 2. I could see the runway as I flew over it on the missed approach off RWY 2. I got on the ground and had a 'kind' word with Mr. X. I called ATC and they told me they needed to follow up on a possible pilot deviation. They had told me that I climbed to 2700 ft; instead of the published 1900 ft on the missed approach off of runway 2. I had no idea that was what happened.

I led her to door 1L jumpseat to speak with her as fellow crew members continued the service. She was loud and telling me 'I'm a senior citizen and I should have been upgraded; I can no longer sit in that middle seat! Does [the company] have senior citizen seating?; I responded with 'No ma'am but we do have [premium economy seats].' She gets louder and say '[the company] discriminates against senior citizens? Even the XX Transit has senior citizen seating!' I kindly ask her to keep her voice down; that I am right here listening and we do not need to disturb the FC customers. Then she really starts yelling and says 'No I won't keep my voice down! What will you do - punch me in the teeth and drag me out!? You want to be on the news?!' Fellow crew member leads her to the main cabin to get away from FC and the flight deck and I called the flight deck to let them know of the situation. We agreed that if this escalated; authorities might need to meet the flight. At this point she sat in 16A; in our designated crew rest area. I sit next to her to explain that unfortunately with our full flight I could not offer a different seat and that this was designated for crew use and not passengers. I ask her to kindly take her assigned seat as we would need to take up her seating issue with ground staff upon landing. She refused. She actually crossed her arms and closed her eyes and refused. She said 'I'm not going; you can just drag me out.' She would not tell me her name or seat assignment; she said she lost her boarding card. I told her if she did not comply with crew direction I would need to get the captain involved and that would likely mean that authorities would need to meet the flight. She said 'I don't care; I'm not moving.'I went forward to advise crew and flight deck. When I returned to the main cabin with a fellow flight attendant to find her original seat so I could look on my Link at her name; I saw that she had then taken her original seat. I did not further engage her as now she was where she needed to be. She was fine the remainder of the flight. Upon deplaning; as I stood at door 1L; she deliberately slammed her carry-on luggage into/against my legs. I was completely dumbfounded; as were the captain and 2 other flight attendants that witnessed this. The captain stepped on to the jet bridge to stop her but she was already gone. This woman was disruptive and belligerent and advanced herself to a level 2 security threat; though fortunately while on the ground. It is out of principle that I am so upset and feel this needs to be addressed. The blatant disrespect for crew and disregard for civility is a major problem.Additionally; she was traveling with her daughter whom was also a bit of a problem. During the service she was in the FC cabin waiting for a restroom. When I asked her to please utilize the restrooms in the main cabin; as now those carts were out of the aisle and we were in the middle of the service; she refused. She complained later to crew about me that 'That witch told me I cannot use the bathroom up front.' These customers are on return flight next week.

After arriving to the aircraft and completing my preflight the Captain that was riding in the jump seat for training informed me that there was a small maintenance delay. We ended up boarding shortly thereafter. It was the first flight of the day but the taxi was unusually long and passengers were asking me questions I had no answer to because no announcements were made. Finally I called back to ask if everything was alright. The pilot said that everything was fine and it was just gonna be a long taxi. We sat there for what felt like an hour. Passengers are becoming more upset seeing as they did not receive any updates or announcements. After that I only heard from the pilots before takeoff to tell me to be seated for departure. When we got into the air I had the usual questions from passengers asking when we were landing and if they were going to be making their connections. The pilot made an announcement that air traffic control would be holding us for about ten extra minutes in the air. Around XC:00 is when I received my before landing chime. At this point the passengers were very irate. Particularly passengers in seat YYA; YYB; and XXB. When we landed about 10 minutes later the taxi was taking a while and every time the plane would jerk or brake the passengers would try to take off their seat belts or get up. So I made an announcement again letting them know they needed to remain seated until the seat-belt sign was extinguished. At that point YYB gets upset and starts conversing with XXB telling XXB how it's amateur hour back there and that's why they are missing their trip. At this point is when XXB unbuckles their seat-belt and leans over the seat pointing and cursing at me red in the face saying 'This is the worst flight ever. It's even worse coming back to [the departure airport]. [This airline] sucks. You guys are terrible. Terrible.' I told XXB they needed to sit down and put their seat-belt back on. Passenger YYB and XXB continued to ignore me and XXB continued to be belligerent. I called back to the flight deck and told the pilot that if this passenger continues to be this way I will be needing security to meet us at the aircraft. After that call was made to the flight deck; the Pilot made an announcement saying we were about 5 minutes away from the gate. We arrived at the hardstand parking shortly thereafter. I received the chime to open the main cabin door and waited for the prop be tied as [the ground crew] connected the step and set up the cones for them to deplane. When the prop was tied and I got the ok to deplane the flight deck door opened. The pilot that was in the jump seat came out of the flight deck and stood in the corridor by the lavatory right next to me while we deplaned. Shortly after a few passengers deplane the passenger in XXB walks up to me near the flight deck and starts yelling and put their hands not even 3 inches away from my face speaking loudly and being abrasive pointing and yelling at both the Pilot and I. As XXB starts getting closer to me I feel unsafe so I tell them they need to move away from me and I raise my hands to cover my face because XXB continues to raise their hands in my face and keeps raising their voice being very disruptive and threatening. As soon as I did so the Pilot tells me to turn my face away; ignore them; and just let them deplane.

So I made the same request AGAIN. He told me he was keeping his laptop on his lap because he could. I was wrong. I then informed him that I was not wrong and that it was in my manual as such and I would be happy to show him. Finally he said I will put it away but you are wrong and then told to LEAVE HIM ALONE. I talked to the CA of the situation. CA told me to show him in magazine where it is required to stow laptops. I didn't because as I said it would have escalated. This sort of behavior is unacceptable in exit row passenger. This man was of course one of the airline's [high] mile passenger. It is a shame because they hold a status that we cannot do our jobs. Something truly needs to be done. Our hands seemed to be tied and I have a plane full of passenger to protect.

Right after we leveled off Mrs. X (XXB) rang her FA call button and asked to be reseated; as her husband (pointing to XXC) was drunk and disturbing her. I informed Mrs. X that we had few open seats and would look into it. I went to the front to locate an empty seat and to inform the lead FA and the Captain about the situation. When I returned to row XX; Mrs. X informed that she would like to stay where she was for the moment and if things didn't improve she would call. I offered both of them water; which was refused; and walked away. During the 1st beverage service; when I reached row XX I heard Mr. X asking the FA-B if she was serving alcohol on the flight; which she replied 'no'. FA-B went to the back to get the drinks for seats XXA and XXB; then Mr. X asked me if I had alcohol in my cart and I informed him that I had; however alcohol would not be served to him during the flight. He asked why and I informed that we were aware he was already under the influence of alcohol and that was the reason he would not be served any alcohol. He asked what other drinks we had and requested a cranapple juice. At that point the FA-B came with the drinks for the other the other two passengers and he started arguing with her why she said she didn't have alcohol. FA-B informed Mr. X; she said she wasn't serving him alcohol; but he continued the argument and she walked away without saying anything. At that moment he called her out loud '[expletive]' and I told Mr. X to please watch his language and respect the crew; and his reply was '[explicit] you'. I walked away and called the lead FA to inform about the incident; which it was addressed to the Captain and local police requested to meet the flight upon arrival. Later on during the arrival services FA-B spilled water on the cart accidentally and a few drops went on Mr. X's arm; he started to be verbally [abusive] saying that she was about to be on 'the news'. 1:15 minutes before landing passenger [in the row in front of the intoxicated passenger] was having medical problems and while I was walking back with an oxygen bottle from the front of the aircraft; I noticed Mr. X standing by the aft lavatories talking to the FA-B and I saw when she closed the curtain and he went back to his seat. Apparently he was telling her what to do with the passenger with medical needs; but she asked him to return to his seat and closed the curtain. While I was assisting a volunteer nurse with the medical situation; Mr. X started to disrupt me stating how upset he was with the fact that the FA-B closed the curtain. I told him that I was busy with a medical situation and wasn't going to get involved with his issue at that time. When I was turning back to assist the nurse and passenger; he grabbed my arm which I asked him not to touch me at all and leave me alone at that time. Few minutes later Mr. X gets up in order for Mrs. X to get up and use the lavatory. When she comes out on the aisle she says thank you to me as I moved out of the way and I replied 'you're welcome'. At this moment Mr. X comes on my direction verbally abusive telling me not to talk to his wife or else I would regret; threatening to physically attack me and to sue the FA-B and myself; I asked Mr. X to stand back and get back on his seat; which he didn't and he was getting more and more agitated and closer. The Nurse had to step in the situation and calm him down; getting him seated. I called the Captain and the lead FA about the additional incident. After that he remained in his seat until escorted out of the aircraft by the local police.",,,,"A321 Flight Attendant reported an abusive and drunk passenger in flight.

I arrived and got the passengers in the airplane. I see a lot of the same passengers every day; but I had never flown these people before. One of the passengers was riding in the front seat next to me which is allowed under the regulations for our type of operation and aircraft. I knew that they had flown with another company pilot earlier in the day; so I gave an abbreviated passenger briefing including seat belts; flotation devices; emergency exits; and what to do in case of an emergency. I did not include crew-member interference in the briefing; and that turned out to be a mistake.  We departed. It was a nice day; and there were quite a few other airplanes out flying. The passenger in the front seat kept pointing them out to me. I didn't really mind him doing that then because we were in cruise and it's alright to have two sets of eyes looking out for traffic; especially during low workload times. Then he noticed the analog cylinder head gauge wasn't reading any temperature; and he began to tap on it. He kept tapping at it then looking at me; so I felt compelled to talk to him. He wasn't wearing a headset so I yelled over at him that we have a digital cylinder head temperature gauge; which I pointed out; and I told him that everything was fine. As we began to descend; I was getting busier. He pointed out another airplane that I was in radio contact with. The passenger pointing out airplanes was beginning to get distracting; so I nodded at him and motioned for him to put his arm down. He was monitoring my descent profile very closely and scanning the gauges. I thought that maybe he was just a very keen passenger; but had a sneaking suspicion that he might be a pilot. As we got on final approach; he jerked his arm up violently to point out what I was sure would be an airplane that was going to hit us. It was a bird which was about 100 feet above us. However; his action startled me; and I was beginning to get angry about his over-reactions to everything. At this point we were short final; and I was fighting a little with a gusty cross wind. Just after touching down; I felt an incessant poking on my throttle hand. I was attempting to ignore it and focus on directional control; but eventually looked down briefly during the roll-out. Of course; the passenger had been poking me in the hand; and then once he saw I was looking; started pointing and tapping on the prop control which I had left in the cruise position and had forgotten to push forward. I quickly ushered his hand away from the engine controls. Now I was sure he was a pilot; but as I was taxiing off the runway I was seeing red I was so angry. I glanced over at him for a second and he looked very smug that he had gotten to correct a perceived mistake; which of course made me angrier. I simply could not believe that a possible pilot would have interfered with my duties during a critical phase of flight for something that was no longer relevant; especially after having startled me during the final approach anyway. Once we were parked; I asked him if he was a pilot; and I discovered that he was a private pilot. I did discuss with him my crew-member duties; the various distractions that he had caused me during my duties; and how to not interfere with a crew-member again. Lessons learned from this incident: 1) Pilots can make terrible passengers in the cockpit. Pilots should announce themselves prior to flight to the PIC if they are wanting to help the pilot scan for traffic. 2) Always give a full passenger brief to passengers that I have not already personally and fully briefed that day.",,,,"C206 pilot reported that a pilot-qualified passenger's incessant input regarding traffic and other aspects of the flight caused undue interference and distraction.",

They were just behind me as I stepped off the aircraft. The agent saw for himself and stated to me after seeing the passengers words and gestures...'I would say that is threatening behavior!'Also; though I did not seat them in premium economy; I did allow both passengers to remain in premium economy seating; because I felt threatened and didn't want the situation to escalate any further. The passengers around them were becoming uneasy; by the looks on their faces.Upon reflection; I realized that I could have done things differently (there is always room for improvement) but I have to blame fatigue after waiting 3 hours in a hot airport prior to boarding this flight (my 3rd for the day).The event happened as followed:Prior to boarding the gate agent stated that there will be those that want to move to premium economy without being charged. She wanted to make us aware beforehand. I notified the flight attendant in the aisle of the gate agents briefing. While boarding Passenger Mr. X and his wife Ms. X entered. Mr. X asked that he and his wife be seated together because she has severe anxieties and didn't want her to cause a scene.I advised him that if once in the air and after the seatbelt sign goes off he could ask to switch seats with another passenger and informed him that he could not sit in premium economy without an upcharge. He did not like my answer. He said 'look at her (now standing in first class cabin)...just look at her.' I didn't see anything out of the ordinary with her behavior; except she looked agitated. I asked him to speak to the flight attendant in the aisle for assistance in order to keep the boarding process moving.Before closing the door; I went to check on these 2 passengers and seen that they were sitting in an empty row in premium economy. I asked them if they would like to pay the upcharge for the seats they were occupying and he said with a stern voice 'NO!' He became very angry to the point his wife said 'Stop it' and popped him in the chest with her left hand- 2 different times.. He said very angrily and loud that 'I am NOT moving!' I told him that we will not be able to close the cabin door if they do not return to their original seats. At that point he went but not without stating how 'sorry' I was and that I should allow them to sit together because of her anxiety. I did not feel safe because of how angry he became when I told him to go back to his seat.I informed the captain who wanted to give him another chance and not take him off the flight. After the seatbelt sign was turned off I called to the back galley and asked the other FA to see if they could reseat them in economy or get someone to trade their economy seat. 30 minutes later I went through the cabin to find them seated once again in the premium economy seats. I stopped and asked them if they had decided to do an upcharge. Mr. X once again became inflamed at me stating 'NO; we did not! Your flight attendant moved us here.' I replied that they should not have done that. Because he stated again in a loud forceful and threatening tones that I didn't understand and that sometimes exceptions need to be made. Stating that his wife had a disability with her anxiety.I told him in calm tones that I understand as my own family members suffer from severe anxiety; but we still cannot assign them to seats that they did not pay for. He said 'Next time I fly; I will just sit where I want to and I will NOT move.' This angry; threatening tones with me was causing a scene with the surrounding passengers; for this reason; I left them there for the duration of the flight rather than move them again. Before leaving them; I asked his wife if she was ok and he said; 'Yes; NOW she is...NO thanks to you!'I have never felt so harassed in my life and bullied by a passenger. I thought we all agreed beforehand that we weren't going to move passengers to premium economy without charging; but this passenger was better left alone. When we landed I reported Mr. X and his wife to the gate agent. I stepped onto the jet bridge just before they came off so that I could point them out to him.

She confirmed the #3 FA's assessment; but said that after she talked to them; the three women were now apologetic and more subdued. She had separated the three; and told me that they all promised to behave for the rest of the flight. Based upon her input I cancelled the gate return and we took off and flew to destination with no issues. I observed several passengers thanking the #1 FA profusely as they exited the aircraft. I was last off the aircraft; and exiting the gate I saw all 3 FA's standing at the podium talking to the gate agents. I was informed that the three problem passengers had insisted on speaking to a supervisor as soon as they exited the jetway. I advised the three FAs to file individual passenger disturbance reports; and I am filing this report.  I might add that in my preflight FA briefings; as on this flight; I now include the topic of passenger disturbance and emphasize following the Flight Manual and FA manual to the letter. The three women were very clearly trying to provoke an incident worthy of [social media] and the news media. Their language included 'bad publicity' and 'what are you going to do' and other such references. I have no doubt that this was an attempted copycat incident in light of the spate of recent events on several different airlines. I asked the #1 FA whether she could smell alcohol on the three women but received a negative reply.  Enforce existing Federal Law and rules on aircraft consistently and even-handedly.

The passenger had already attempted to move himself to a business class seat and then insisted that the entire row in economy was his (even though he had only purchased one seat). The Captain asked her to keep us informed if she could not resolve the issue. A short period of time later; she returned stating that the passenger continued to be non-compliant and continued his verbal abuse which included cussing at other passengers. The Captain decided to confront the passenger personally and requested assistance [from] the gate agents. After genuine efforts to reason with the passenger; the Captain received the same non-compliant response and verbal abuse. The passenger refused to answer the Captain's questions and stated to the Captain he would have to 'drag' him off. And what was described to me as pleading/begging to be dragged off. At this point; we brought the [Operations Manager] into the loop and requested the local ground security to be notified. We declared a Threat Level One and reviewed that procedure.The [Operations Manager] was first questioning if we could attempt to reason with the passenger; we stated that that had already been attempted for over 30 minutes by the inflight crew; gate agents and the Captain. The Captain had already made the decision to remove him at this time because the passenger would not comply with his instructions and continued his verbal abuse to passengers around him. He was a clear safety threat; as well as at this point; surrounding passengers were not comfortable with him staying on the flight. This passenger knew exactly what to do (though I don't know if it was premeditated) he immediately used his new-found empowerment to tell the Captain he would not comply and basically begged; 'drag me off'. This is a provocation that cannot [be allowed to continue] in the future.The whole crew; agents and [Operations Manager] contemplated how to handle the situation and continued various attempts to instruct the passenger to leave the aircraft. The [Operations Manager] did not want to deplane the aircraft for fear of a further delay; but later agreed after discussions with local agents; it was the only option. In the meantime; the other passengers began to become extremely agitated and anxious. There were reports that some passenger offered to remove him and another woman came to the cockpit with her concerns of potential violence erupting and that she did not want her daughter to witness any more of the ordeal. As the onboard passengers became more agitated; more and more were leaving their seats to interject; observe and take photos and video. We received a report from a flight attendant that 'we were close to 'losing control' of the cabin'. An announcement was made for everyone to be seated and was successful. The plan was now to deplane everyone (and the local police wanted the flight attendants to deplane as well for their own safety) and then local police would remove him. The deplaning began and it was reported that the passenger kicked a girl and cussed at just about everyone as they left and many passengers had derogatory comments toward the passenger as they deplaned. Since the passenger kicked a girl during the deplaning; we declared Threat Level two. But again; we as a crew were helpless to remove him without some sort of physical act. He was able to do as he pleased because I feel he felt 'empowered' by [recent industry incidents]. Later in this process; after the police boarded the deplaned aircraft; the [Operations Manager] instructed us 'do not let the local police touch him'. As it turns out; I believe the local police were reluctant to physically remove him due to jurisdiction. The local police later produced paperwork that they requested the Captain to sign as a release for them to remove him. The [Operations Manager] informed the Captain to not sign anything. As time rolled on; and the situation continued to [escalate]; the passenger attempted to negotiate a deal with the gate agents. He demanded a boarding pass in his hands on another flight before he would voluntarily leave the aircraft. I felt at this point [the passenger was] basically holding the aircraft hostage with his empowerment; and attempting to negotiate a deal; would qualify as a hijacking and would require the situation to be considered Threat Level 4. The cockpit was not aware of this negotiation attempt until later; and the gate agents refused to honor his requests.Fortunately; after hours of this very tense situation; [a] Flight Attendant pleaded with him one last time; and his approach was effective and successful. He told the passenger; 'we are going nowhere; things are only going to get worse for you; just grab your bag and follow me'. Amazingly; the passenger decided to leave voluntarily. Though in his last act of defiance; he shoved [the flight attendant] as he left the airplane. Again; Threat Level Two. This is not a situation our flight crews; gate agents; customers; [company]; nor the industry should allow to continue or escalate.  This event was of grave safety concern to me and the other crew members in the aftermath. This is a safety issue that needs to be addressed and reviewed for future protocol. This event cannot be ignored in the best interest waiting for social media to die down; but I feel it is a situation that will continue and could escalate into a negative event for [our company] (which this one nearly did) and more importantly; a safety hazard for our crews and passengers.I would describe this event as basically an 'emergency' type event on the ground; however none of the SOP with the crew has been addressed toward that policy by the company.  But neither one has been addressed by Management to this date. The Captain did submit an IOR (Irregular Operations Report) and with this incident; maybe there will be a debrief and review; but I felt after the passenger was off the airplane; we may have too quickly resumed status quo with a recovery plan. This was a long and tense ordeal. I felt the crew did a tremendous job; though not easy; of re-focusing; re-boarding and operating the aircraft to an alternate station. This is what we are trained to do; but in cases like this one; where we don't have hind sighted guidance; we may want to assess our state of mind as crew members before we continue on in an immediate fashion.Also; I have no idea what this passenger did other than booking himself on a later flight and attempting to check-in. He violated US Federal laws; but I don't think anything will be done; which is a concern toward potential future events. I think something should be done toward procedures and protocol for an empowered passenger who chooses to refuse to follow direction or leave the aircraft on command. And who uses provocation of the crew and agents to physically remove them. For the concern of the future safety of our crews; passengers; and the goodwill of [the company]. Me personally; in hindsight and with the aftermath of finally returning home a day later; I felt the same feeling I would have if I handled a different serious aircraft emergency.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"Air Carrier flight crew reported a passenger misconduct issue delayed departure when the passenger refused to deplane voluntarily.",

It started with one of the Flight Attendants calling the cockpit saying a Passenger had grabbed her by the lapel of her shirt and pulled her towards him demanding to know if the American Flag pin on her collar was an ICE (Immigrations and Customs Service) pin. The suspect was aggressive towards the Flight Attendant. After she called; we went in lockdown and I made the assumption and told the FAs and FO that this was a Level 1 Threat. I notified Dispatch and began coordinating our arrival to ZZZ. After several minutes; and after looking at the Ops Binder; I realized that it was in fact a Level 2 Threat. The suspect continued to use aggressive language towards both female Flight Attendants but did not become more physically aggressive after the initial confrontation. The FAs told me that two Company Ramp Personnel were seated in front of the suspect and they had offered any and all assistance in case the suspect became more aggressive.We were only about 30 minutes from ZZZ when this started; the FO continued his flying duties and I coordinated with the FAs; Dispatch; Center and Ground Operations at ZZZ. It was a busy time for both of us and there was weather in the area to deviate around that added to the conditions at hand. The FO did a masterful job flying and talking with ATC; but I felt as though we were in and out of the green and yellow a number of times. In the descent; we decided to [advise ATC of the situation]. This really reduced the workload and distraction as ATC gave us direct ZZZ with deviations as necessary.Operating on the edge of the green and yellow; over a period of time; has a physiological effect that I never saw before. First off; there was an increased level of stress; not knowing if this guy was going to lose it and become combative; in which case would have meant an immediate divert; and in that case; would we then be intercepted and escorted to our destination. This along with the coordination quite obviously gets the adrenaline going. With that said; the one error that I know I made was taxiing about half-way into the Safety Zone before I realized there was no Marshaller in place to guide us in. I stopped; waited for him to come and the rest of the taxi in was uneventful.",,,,"B737 Captain reported a Flight Attendant had been grabbed by her shirt by an aggressive passenger.

He is an avionics tech attempting to enroute check us for a free ride to an international destination. ASI inspector is sporting a beard/goatee. I informed him of the FOM (Flight Operations Manual) and explained the grooming code of conduct. I asked him to take a seat in back. He refused. My FO and I were then directly threatened with losing our licenses to fly. He said 'The last pilot that attempted to have him removed had his license revoked by the FAA and never flew again.' I immediately called for Supervisor help.  We were being threatened at a high level. The Supervisor came to our support and we both sincerely appreciate his efforts. He suggested complete removal. We had a choice. Either the ASI leaves; we leave or the ASI moves to a seat in back. At this point we were pushing CCO (Crew Critical Offtime) times and if we removed the ASI from the airplane both I and my FO would have to follow protocol and file reports before departure to protect us. This would have cancelled the flight and caused a huge disruption to our operation. At this point the distraction and disruption was elevated high enough to walk off. My FO and I decided the easiest and quickest recovery of the operation was to seat the ASI in the back and go. The ASI called his supervisor who confirmed leaving the cockpit and take a seat in the cabin. The ASI delayed our flight by having to go on to the ramp to find a signal for his cell phone to get hold of his office. No crewmember should EVER be threatened like this from an ASI.

I took a screen shot using my iPad of the recent company policy letter concerning social media issues and company policy in dealing with and diffusing it.

She wanted the passenger removed. I was hesitant thinking it was just an outburst. I received another report from a male flight attendant saying she wanted help with her bag. The flight attendant told her he does not put passenger bags in the overhead. She told him [this company] does not want to help her because she is black. I told him just tell her to behave. We pushed back from the gate. I got a call saying the passenger would not turn off the cell phone and she was calling to make a complaint. I told him; ok; I am going to make a PA. During the PA I said; if the passenger using the phone does not turn it off we were going to go back to the gate.I didn't hear another complaint until we were deplaning. I was told she was complaining and trying to get other passengers riled up during the flight. She was recording the flight attendants during their service. When she was getting off she said it was the worst flight she had ever been on; and what kind of landing was that? The first officer said she was cursing and complaining all the way into the building. I was worried about an incident like the flight where the passenger refused to deplane and was dragged out. After the flight when I heard she was accusing [this company] of racism; recording the crew; and the crew saying she was looking for a confrontation it confirmed my suspicion.Maybe the woman was looking for compensation or celebrity status. A first officer gave me a good suggestion the same day. He said; if the passenger does not deplane; everyone must deplane. When everyone gets off. Allow everyone on except the unruly passenger. I think after 9/11 the passengers were very respectful of the crews.

Upon taxiing out thunderstorms delayed the flight from departing for approximately two hours. While number three for takeoff flight received ACARS message from Dispatch to return to gate for inspection due to possible hail damage. After arriving at the gate Captain asked First Officer to contact operations asking for Complaint Resolution Officer due to unruly passenger. Observation of passenger indicated he was extremely belligerent; agitated; and was filming crew threatening legal action. His behavior was becoming increasingly hostile and unpredictable upsetting other passengers and making flight attendants fearful for their safety. Captain made the decision to call for law enforcement to guard against any physical violence escalation. After the Conflict Resolution person arrived the entire aircraft was deplaned (hail inspection) and unruly passenger placed on later flight at crews request. Law enforcement never appeared despite Captain's request from CSR and supervisor. This is a clear indication of overriding Captain's authority; responsibility; and decision to request law enforcement. The Captain now does not have the confidence law enforcement will be called when necessary.",,"Flight was delayed due to weather. Held at gate due to ramp closure twice. Finally taxied out; sat on taxiway with bad weather and a wheels up time. Was away from the gate for maybe around two hours. (I do not have the brake release to brake set time).Hail pelted A320; we were instructed to return to gate Returned to gate; agent opened aircraft door and disappeared without giving passengers instructions or me; the purser. Captain told passengers they could get off the aircraft. Later found out agents at the gate were working [a different] flight at that gate but we used the gate so [they] gate changed.At least one agent should have stayed at that gate with our flight and should have instructed passengers on what to do; since we had been on the taxiway for so long and now were back at the gate with a mechanical. The agent just opened the aircraft door and left. They should not have done that after we were out on the ramp for an extended amount of time and we did not know how long the delay was going to be; passengers did not know what to do. So the passengers started coming up front to ask me questions. I could not answer the questions since the agent did not give us any instructions at that opening of the door. Captain went up the jet bridge to help an elderly non English speaking passenger because we had no wheelchairs meet the flight and the agent left us without me being able to tell her we needed a wheelchair. So the captain helped the elderly woman up the jet bride and told me he would also get an agent to come back down to instruct the passengers; the agent never should have left us after she opened the door; did not even tell me and everyone else she was now going to go over to the next gate; so the captain went up to find an agent to instruct the passengers. At this point a passenger came up to door 1L where I was; turned on his phone and started videotaping me saying he was recording and this was going to go to court. Mr. X was agitated and appeared to be crazy. I looked at the first officer; and told him to go get an agent immediately and get this Mr. X off the plane as he made me fear for my safety and felt threatened. So the first officer left the plane to get a Customer Service Representative (CSR); as the captain had not come back yet. Now it was just 3 flight attendants; all by ourselves dealing with quite a few upset passengers up by door 1L and I stared to fear for our safety as if anything happened to one of us; especially by Mr. X; we could not get off the plane with a plane full of passengers and we had no assistance. A CSR supervisor and the captain at some point; finally came back down to the plane and both had instructed us they had called for police assistance for Mr. X but [the company] would not send the police to the gate to get Mr. X off the plane. It is very unsafe for us to not be able to have police come to our assistance when it is needed. How unsafe and negligent of [our company to] not allow the police to come down when a captain who is responsible for his aircraft; crew and passengers; calls for police assistance. This is the only tool a crew has to remove an irate; videotaping passenger who won't comply with crew member instructions and stop videotaping us. Videotaping of crew needs to be illegal. We felt unsafe and threatened.A CSR customer service passenger handling supervisor finally came down and started talking to Mr. X; then another person came down; then another person came down. Mr. X at first got off the plane to talk to the first supervisor; but got back on the plane and would not get off the plane when another supervisor woman wanted to talk to him so she got on the plane to talk to him; we was still videotaping saying a bunch of stuff and that this video was going to court. Mr. X kind of had her up against door 1R still videotaping her and saying things in a threatening tone but I could not quite hear what he was saying.So we ended up deplaning the whole planeso we could get Mr. X off and also because I think [the company] was unsure of the delay because they had to check the aircraft for hail damage. Finally we had some help down on the plane. So number 1. When we returned to the gate a CSR should have stayed with the gate; and made sure an announcement telling the passengers what to do should have been made because those not getting any instructions made just about every passenger angry. It's also not safe to not have a CSR at the gate with a delayed aircraft in the event of an emergency.Number 2. A CSR or someone should have come back down to the gate much quicker and instructed the passengers instead of leaving just the flight attendants on the aircraft being put into a potentially unsafe situation. There were two Federal Air Marshals on our flight they got off and I asked to please also get a CSR to the plane as soon as possible. Number 3. Under no circumstances should a captain be denied police assistance when he asks for it as it is a huge safety risk to his plane; crew and customers.It was an unsafe situation and very bad customer service.",,"A320 Captain and the Purser involved reported a return to the gate to inspect for hail damage at which point a passenger became irate and was removed from the flight.",

I explained to her we were still flying though almost there and I told her she needed to return to her seat. She did with no incident. I saw her to her seat and she fastened her seatbelt. I asked her to keep her seatbelt fastened and told her we would be landing soon. I then walked to the rear of the aircraft and told Flight Attendant (FA) 2 my flying partner; to keep an eye on her and I explained what she had said. FA 2 passed the word on to FA 3. I returned to my duties in first class. The passenger in 3E asked if he could help; and I told him everything was fine but yes; he could help me if she returned and I needed him.Approximately 15 minutes later; during final descent; I heard some yelling and saw the passenger coming up the aisle. I stopped her at row 7 and told her she need to return to her seat as we were landing. She let me walk her to her seat; I was holding her at the elbows from behind; as I could see she was unsteady. I sat her and fastened her seatbelt. I then noticed she was becoming agitated; bothering the passengers around her and trying to expose [herself]. At that point we were landing but I felt the safest course of action was to sit someone with her to ensure she did not touch anyone nor try to get up. I enlisted the help of a passenger; a male flight attendant. I removed the passenger next to [the individual] and put the passenger there. We agreed he could keep her calm until landed. While walking back up to my jumpseat I could hear a commotion and returned to row 30; where [this individual] was clearly increasingly agitated; slapping away attempts to keep her seated and calm; She then proceeded to expose herself again and I decided it would be best if I sat next to her. I asked [the passenger who tried to help] to take my jumpseat and perform door landing duties including door disarming and such when needed. I notified FA 3 what I was doing. All of this was happening during sterile cockpit.Upon landing I rang the call button and told my flying partner FA 2 to call the cockpit; explain what was happening and have security meet the aircraft. All the while I am literally holding [the woman in question] down; speaking quietly to her; trying to de-escalate her agitation. She repeatedly tried to stand; touch the passenger in 30F inappropriately; and climb over him and out the window. She continued to expose herself and I repeatedly told her to keep her top on and I kept trying to cover her. This was all physically almost impossible but I tried my best to calm her down and get to stop touching other passengers and saying inappropriate things. She seemed to respond.Upon arrival at the gate FA 3 made all announcements for me; including for the passengers to remain seated so security could enter the aircraft. When they opened the door no one was there; only an agent; no security. We sat; with me holding [the woman] and trying to keep her calm; for 10 minutes and no one came. Finally the captain made an announcement that we were not going to hold the passengers hostage since security did not show up and they could leave. It was getting increasingly difficult to hold [the woman].The passengers got up and started to deplane and one security person arrived. He came back to row 30 and proceeded to attempt to walk [the woman] up the aisle. She became agitated and began taking off her shirt again and exposing herself. I pulled her shirt down; told her to stay covered; and covered her with my arms as best I could. She fought security and I asked him to let go and I would help her walk up. This calmed her.When we got into the jetway there was no one there to help up. I was holding [the woman] as she could barely stand. And the First Officer (FO); was there and I told him we needed the police and paramedics. He told me he was a police officer. She became agitated when he lookedat her so he turned his back to her. He stood strong so I had support and she did not realize he was a man. (Men increased her hysteria). I held her upright by the wall with his help while we waited for the police and paramedics. The FO was such a huge help as my concern was that she would run back onto the aircraft and he prevented her from doing so without her realizing what was happening.About 20 minutes later the police finally arrived. They were able to get [the woman] into a wheelchair and took her in to the airport. She did not know where she was; thought she was in Dallas; and repeatedly tried to stand. The paramedics finally arrived and put her on a gurney to go to the hospital.This situation escalated quickly during sterile cockpit and we notified the captain as soon as physically possible; which was after touchdown.

During the flight I realized there was a crate under a passenger seat. I then asked the C flight attendant if she was aware about the animal. Her answer was 'no'. I then took a look at the paperwork that was given to me and I realized there was a code 'ESAN' which we figured out meant emotional support animal. We were not aware of what kind of animal but since it was listed we figured the proper procedures had been reviewed prior to boarding. Which is normal protocol for any animal that boards our aircraft. When we landed in Mexico City and going through customs we then realized it was a monkey in the crate. The C flights attendant asked the owner if monkeys were allowed in Mexico to which the owner responded yes. That she has traveled with the monkey before and it's never been a problem. The following morning we arrived at our gate for our departure and we see the family at the gate. They had been detained in Mexico because of the monkey. After arriving we had some ground time. Before our next flight we were notified that our arriving aircraft had been quarantined because of the monkey. As you can see this was a huge inconvenience not only for the family but for us as crew and the airline.

She explains to FA A that he will 'know who they are' when they come on. FA A asked Ops why they were allowing them to board and when Ops didn't provide an answer; FA A went to the Captain and asked the Captain why they were allowing them to board. The Captain then interrupted boarding and went down to talk with the Ops agent about the situation. Apparently; because of the events that followed; the Ops agent was able to satisfy the Captain's question. Two bachelor parties come on board; each smelling of alcohol. One party had 5-7 men (estimated) and the other 7-10 men and women (estimated). Both parties had been drinking several hours due to their flights being late or delayed. Ops positioned a policeman on the tarmac to 'keep an eye' on the groups to make sure they didn't do anything wrong. Why even have that if Ops didn't know they were already intoxicated? Most men came on very loud; boisterous; obnoxious; profane and smelling of alcohol. There was no mistaking the smell. Additionally; the smaller of the two groups began to harass the FA B on boarding in the back; catcalling her and making comments out loud as she walked by them. Once on board; they began being loud and rude throughout the entire back part of the plane. We could hear them in the front after the FA A made the opening PA. At this time; FA B made her way to the front to say that she would not and could not work back there. She said we needed to take passengers off because of their loud behavior; rudeness and level of intoxication. At this point the Ops Supervisor came on board and went to smooth over the situation and explain to the groups that there would be no alcohol served on the flight. As she starts talking to the groups; one man decided to mouth off to her and she quickly realized the situation and began steps to pull him off the plane. The man would not comply; so she called for a policeman. Two policemen then came on board and informed the man that he would not be flying to ZZZ and the man began to get even more upset while several of the friends in his group began to make even more noise about it being unjust that they are pulling the man from the flight. After a few minutes of the man arguing the man decided to come up to the front of the plane. Once in the front of the plane; Captain began talking to him and explaining to him why he was not going to ZZZ. The policeman then grabbed him by the arm and pulled him off the plane. Once the man was off the plane; the Captain then asked for the three Flight Attendants; the Ops Supervisor and himself to meet out on the ramp. The FA B stayed on the plane while the Captain asked what we wanted to do. All three of us said we wanted to take the groups off and; at least; did not want to serve during the 46 minute flight. The Captain informed us that we were going to do a water service with no alcohol. The Ops agent then said they needed to push the plane due to a terminator coming in. At this point; Captain made a PA to the plane that we were only going to do a limited service of water and that no alcohol would be served. As the Captain finished his PA; he said 'My name is John Doe. John Doe.' As he finished; the B was at mid cabin counting and one of the passenger yelled 'John Doe is a jerk!' at the top of his voice. B immediately turned around and tried to determine who said this. Noticing that the man we thought said it was getting elbowed by his girlfriend and being told to be quiet. This caused another stir and at this point we wanted both groups pulled off for good. Another Ops Sup came on board (who told us she had seen them drinking for several hours in the airport) and went to confront both groups again. Without being able to positively identify who the person was; we decided to then switch positions so that the B would not be forced to work in the back with all of these men. 4 policemen then came to determine who we were wanting to remove from the plane. The lead police officer then informed each group that if anything happened on the way to ZZZ that they would be back at our departure airport and having to deal with him upon return that night. Ultimately; the Captain and Ops made the decision to let them all fly. This was against our wishes and judgment. The plane then took off and landed in ZZZ without another incident. We need to stop being scared of lawsuits from intoxicated passengers and have the Ops Agents do their jobs! We can't pass this on to us as we are in a metal tube at 38;000 feet. This situation should have been handled by Ops the way they are instructed to do. Failure to handle the situation in the terminal led to a bunch of people thinking they can say and do whatever they want and not have any repercussions. This entire event will never happen again as long as I work for this Company. I will never let it go again like we did last night.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737 Flight Attendants reported questioning Company Operations and the Captain's decision to depart with a group of intoxicated passengers.",

We auto-parked at our gate in accordance with the extreme weather guidelines before it even started raining. We made an announcement to the passengers about the ramp closure and the safety reasons for keeping the doors closed. The storm was moving incredibly slowly and after 1 hour the Flight Attendant (FA) did a full beverage service and handed out Stroopwafels that had been mis-catered on the airplane. After the second hour we [did] another full beverage service. The ramp opened up after approximately 3:15 from our ON time. We kept the cockpit door open and showed the lightning strikes on a website I found that tracks it and explained the ramp safety rules to the passengers. We had a couple of folks get frustrated; but overall the FA kept the mood calm. It helped that the APU worked and we could keep the cabin comfortable. I'm writing this [report] because ops was asking crews to pop open then reclose their doors in order to capture an IN time so they wouldn't go over the [time] limits. No one was allowed off the planes because of the ramp closure so this didn't meet the actual requirement to let the passengers off so a lot of us were advising crews to keep the doors shut.

The [auto park system] was operational so we parked at our gate. Since the ramp was closed a gate agent couldn't come out and move the passenger bridge to allow the passengers to [be] deplaned. The storm passing over the airport was very slow moving so the ramp continued to be closed. The captain made the required PA announcements per the Flight Operations Manual and when new information became available. Due to the volume of planes on the ground; moving to a gate with a jet bridge was not an option. The required ACARS messages were sent as well. Eventually the ramp was re-opened and we were able to deplane. That put the block time for that flight at 4hr 34min versus the 1hr 3min that was scheduled. The delay on the ground exceeded 3hr.The biggest threat was the weather. The lightning around the airport closed the ramp. Since the gates at IAH consist of metal ramps; having passengers walk down them in a thunderstorm poses obvious risk. Exceeding 3hr on the ground was done in the interest of safety to ramp personnel and the passengers.It's important to keep track of your duty time and flight time throughout the day.

[The passenger] felt scared for her safety and the intoxicated passenger's safety and got up to advise the FA's as we were next for takeoff. A concern was raised about how many pills were consumed and about the safety of the passenger and her heavily medicated state. She was also observed to be pregnant which made the reporting passenger even more worried. I made the decision to return to the gate for observance by a CRO (Complaint Resolution Official); GSC (Ground Security Coordinator); the paramedics and the police. I advised dispatch that we had a level one threat and was assigned a return gate. It was later determined that she overdosed on the pills and was originally on her way for drug rehab.I want to put a kudos out to the flight attendants; my first officer; gate agents; supervisors and all that helped save this passenger's life by speaking up and responding quickly. Without voicing her ultimate concern and doing the right thing we would have potentially faced a more difficult time and possible diversion. When we have IROPs (Irregular Operations) like a return to gate; it can be very difficult to get the team going again. I must say that without my wonderful dispatcher working my flight and promptly getting on the fuelers; operations and coordinating ground support; we would have simply timed out. With the help of the dispatcher we were able to coordinate our extension with crew tracking; get the ATC desk manned with ATC to expedite our taxiing during expected taxi time of 39 minutes and get us airborne 14 minutes from pushback to take off. This saved us from having to go back to the gate and cause further delays/cancellation.On the downside we have got to get something done about our ground crew. We waited entirely too long for a ramp crew to guide us back to the gate. People sit around with not my 'gateitis' instead of jumping in to assist. This is my second overdose this year. In both cases if we had more signage and awareness pertaining to observance of other passengers behaviors and speaking up when something doesn't look right; we could reduce our return to gates and medical diversions. So in conjunction with human trafficking maybe we can also expose the ugly truth with signage about the other elephant in the room; chronic prescription drug abuse and ways to identify those who might be under the influence? In this case passengers saw this lady popping prescription at the gate; while boarding; while taxing and even as she was being escorted off the airplane.",,,,"An Embraer ERJ-175 Captain reported they returned to the gate due to an intoxicated/ill passenger.",

Sure enough; the elderly woman; who was also very large; had to hold onto every seat back as she slowly struggled down the aisle toward the exit row; then with difficulty and using every seatback/armrest as a crutch; hobbled into her window seat. Her husband also seemed physically impaired and walked incredibly slowly but somewhat less so than his wife. He then took his seat [with me sitting between them]. I struck up a conversation with them; asking if they wanted to sit together; and did they know that they were in an Emergency exit row. They declined my offer; but admitted that they booked the seats because of the extra legroom. I asked if the woman was ok; and told her I'd noticed her difficulty walking--she admitted she had had knee surgery in the past. She did not have any noticeable braces. Again; I reminded them that they were in an emergency exit-they did not comment further. When the working flight attendants came to ask the 'are you willing and able to assist in an emergency' question; they both answered in the affirmative.    I did bring up my observation to the crew working in economy later in the flight but they both said that they did not witness this couple's slow and belabored journey to the exit row. This was due to the fact that one of them was busy setting up the economy galley during most of the boarding time; and the other was stationed at the boarding door as a 'greeter'. So; for most of the boarding process; there was nobody in the aisle. In addition; they said that because they'd gotten an affirmative answer to the question; there was nothing they could do. I feel that if I had been working the flight; I might've run into the same problem-and have before. When/if the Flight Attendant (FA) does not actually see the person display something that looks like it could impede their ability to open the window exit quickly; such as limping/weakness/a brace/cast; portable oxygen container etc; it is difficult to remove someone from that row when they deny any such disability.   I personally felt unsafe with this obviously physically impaired woman in charge of opening the exit that was closest to me. She was also so large that I doubt she could've either gotten out of the window quickly (she would definitely not have been able to open it-she tried; but literally could not bend over to pick up the soda can that fell off of her tray table) or even gotten out of the way so that others could get out quickly.     I do know that the actual chances of having to evacuate are relatively slim; but that is beside the point. All of our safety training/knowledge and rules are in place not because of what *usually happens* but what *might happen*.    To that point; I feel that our (and the FAA's) directives on exit row restrictions are too lax and open to exploitation. People choose their seats online most of the time and are obviously ignoring the pop-up warnings to not choose those seats if they are impaired in any way. They simply want the legroom--just as the elderly gentleman (who was actually wearing Velcro strap tennis shoes--he couldn't even tie his shoes!) admitted when I reminded them that they were in an emergency exit. The Customer Service (CS) agent; who also questions passengers seated in exit rows during the ticket scanning process is under pressure to get flights out on time and are frequently overworked. As long as the passenger in question answers affirmatively to their question; again; they cannot remove them; unless there is an obvious brace; crutches etc. Many times; the overworked CS agents allow passengers like this to board in the hopes that the FAs will sort out the problem on-board--be it an obvious child in the exit row or someone impaired like this couple obviously was. It happens all the time.However; we flight attendants are also understaffed. On this particular flight; the 2 FAs working in First Class (FC) were busy setting the forward galley up for service and completing the comprehensive and time consuming pre-departure drink service--which takes the entire boarding process and taxi time to finish in most cases. Passengers often ask for second drinks before the flight takes off--sending the FA back and forth during boarding. We used to give just a small selection of OJ; water or champagne before push-back in FC which was far more conducive to having the time needed to complete cabin safety checks. I feel that because of the poor staffing we have on all of our flights--some worse than others--we are missing things like unsuitable passengers in the exit row and many other; perhaps more dangerous issues.I certainly do not feel safe with the way the regulations are being applied at my airline. The procedures seem to be insufficient in weeding out those who definitely shouldn't be in the exit rows; and we FAs; the trained safety professionals; have almost no power to be able to ensure a suitable person IS at the exit. We have also been told recently that our job is to 'inform; not enforce' the regulations. (Not limited to exit rows.)  Also; it must be mentioned that 'persons of size' should never be seated at an exit WINDOW; (door exit rows excluded) as they would not fit easily/quickly and would most likely impede others' egress in an emergency when fractions of a second count. I cannot fathom how it is actually allowed at my airline and how it is that we are required to provide an extension to those who cannot fit in the standard aircraft seatbelt.",,,,"Deadheading Flight Attendant reported the screening process for emergency exit row passengers which only requires an affirmative answer to the question 'are you willing and able to assist in an emergency?'

She asked if anyone touched the controls.  I explained that post 9/11; there is zero tolerance for anyone touching the controls and if someone did; I would have to report them to the police.During the taxi out she took out her phone and started to take a picture of herself with her hand on the yoke.  I said; 'No!' loudly and moved her hand.  I told her do not touch the controls.She sat quietly for the next 30 minutes or so but then as we were crossing the shoreline [nearing our destination]; she again grabbed the yoke with her left hand and tried to take a picture with her phone in her right hand.  I swatted her hand away again.  As we approached [destination]; I called in range to the gate and asked that a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) meet my plane because a passenger has grabbed the controls twice.

I assumed one or more were police officers.The passengers disembarked and I followed behind; scanning for the LEO.  There was no one.  I went through the gate doors and looked there.  Then I went to baggage claim and looked there.  There were no police officers.  After that; I rushed to our ticket counter to see if they were waiting there.  Again; there was no one.  I asked an employee for the manager and she said he was in his office.  I found him there and asked where the police were.  He was not aware of the situation.

She asked why; I told her 'I noticed you limping and in order to sit in the emergency exit row you need to have full use of your legs and arms.' She refused to be reseated and said that she had been allowed to sit in an emergency row while having her assistive device with her before. I then let the A know what was going on.

The Captain explained that he did not have any authority to overrule the customer service agent. The customer service supervisor said that they were concerned about being sued for discrimination [under the] disabilities act and refused to move her based on that and not wanting to be filmed and out on social media. While inflight the passenger sitting beside her advised that the customer service agent asked her if she was able to operate the exit and she informed her that she had a knee injury and that's the reason she had to use the cane in order to walk. This passenger went on to say that the customer service agent apologized to her for her inconvenience and gave her a voucher to be used her next flight. At no time did the customer service agent disclose to the crew that the passenger informed her that she was injured and had to use her cane to assist her with walking.

The first manager that I spoke with did inform me that the tablet was my guidance and to follow procedure and that the Captain would have the final say. However another supervisor asked if I'd spoken with the lady and if she said she was able to operate the exit then there was nothing further that we could do. I just need clarification on the exit seat criteria. I take this very seriously as I've been in an emergency evacuation before. I'm not sure what needs to happen to not have this occur again.

At that point; we were now in Threat Level 1. During this time; we had already started our descent; so we continued to our destination. Unfortunately; events in the cabin escalated even further and eventually became physical and the disruptive Passenger had to be restrained with the use of the aircraft restraint cuffs. We were then in Threat Level 2. This was apparently a free for all encounter by the F/A`s account and it took an off duty commuting Company FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer) Pilot; a Law Enforcement Officer who was onboard; and possibly two or three other individuals; some of whom had law enforcement experience to subdue this individual. We had previously informed Dispatch and destination Station operations of our situation and they were prepared for us with ample Law Enforcement Officers; Medical Personnel; and Station Representatives as we pulled into the gate. The individual was removed from the aircraft without incident and the F/A's were polled as to their mental frame of mind for our return flight to XXX. Though somewhat startled; they all felt they were up mentally for the return flight to XXX; so we proceeded as planned. To my knowledge; no one was actually physically injured during this event; and destination operations later informed me that the disruptive Passenger had been taken to a local hospital for a mental evaluation.",,"Late in the flight; the F/A (Flight Attendant) contacted us on interphone. As Pilot Monitoring; I took the call; and the Captain was monitoring the communication. The F/A (the A) told us they had a non-cooperative Passenger and described his behavior as pacing the aisles and being very vocal. At that point; the Captain jumped in to manage the situation; and I was prepared to be both Pilot Monitoring and Pilot Flying; but still monitored the cabin situation.The A F/A mentioned the disruptive Passenger was seated in one of the last rows next to an elderly couple and she had enlisted their aid to calm him. The Captain and I discussed it briefly; and our extra resources. In addition to the elderly couple; we had at least two able bodied Passengers: an armed Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) and a commuting Company Captain who was also an FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer). It sounded like the situation was under control.The timing of the flight was such that I had about ten minutes from the hourly ATIS update and Top Of Descent; and it was time to start getting landing information together for Arrival and Approach Briefings. At about that time; the A Flight Attendant called again to say the situation had escalated into a physical confrontation; and they were going to get restraints on the Passenger with aid of the able-bodied Passengers.The Captain and I discussed again; and I sent via ACARS a message to Dispatch that we would need Law Enforcement upon arrival; we had a commuting Pilot plus onboard LEO for help; the situation was under control; and we had a restrained Passenger. Very shortly after that we received a call from the F/A stating the Passenger had broken the restraints; an altercation broke out; and several Passengers had come to their aid; and possible minor injuries. The F/A (in the confusion I don't know which one it was) was very stressed and nearly in tears.The Captain and I discussed an ATC notification. In as much as we were on a straight-in approach to a non-busy airport; we agreed there was little to be gained by asking for priority at that time. We were becoming task-saturated as it was. Instead; the plan was to inform Tower Control at initial contact to get an immediate taxi to the gate after landing.Dispatch had requested more information via ACARS. Since typing on ACARS is slow and we were then within radio range of destination operations; I called them directly on VHF2 to verify Law Enforcement summons and request Paramedics for possible Passenger injuries. The person on the radio was not yet aware of our situation; so I briefed them quickly. As an FFDO I rechecked my equipment in the event that I would need to defend the flight deckThe approach went normally and I notified Tower of our need for taxi priority upon landing; which they approved. I started the APU on short final as a precaution. The Captain flew the aircraft and landing went normally and we proceeded off the high-speed and directly to Gate XX. Law Enforcement was on hand and I think Paramedics were too.",,"A B737 flight crew reported a serious unruly passenger incident while at cruise altitude.

At the time; I thought it was odd and off-color but not disruptive or disorderly. We took off and shortly after climb out; the flight attendants called up and said this same passenger had exchanged seats with his girlfriend; who was sitting in first class. They said he was sleeping and not causing any other problems; so I thought his actions were thoughtless but still not disruptive. About 70 minutes into the flight; the flight attendants called up and said this same passenger had groped one of the other flight attendants. At that time; I decided to divert into PHX; which was about 160 NM in front of us. I sent Dispatch an ACARS message regarding my intentions and the situation to coordinate ground operations and having the authorities meet the aircraft. We informed ATC and told them about the situation. They asked if the cockpit was secure - it was - and gave us direct to a point on the PINGG arrival into PHX. We responded to the queries but soon had to focus on our descent and arrival planning. During the descent; I made a Public Announcement to the customers informing them we had to divert into PHX for a minor indicator problem and that we'd be on the ground in less than 25 minutes. We pulled up the ATIS and briefed our arrival with me as the pilot flying. We were given a visual into Runway 25R and landed uneventfully. After getting a gate assignment; we pulled up with operations on the scene and with their lights flashing. We shut down the engines and completed all the appropriate checklists. I then briefed the operations and other company officials in the jet bridge about the situation. There was a little confusion regarding the passenger in question because he had exchanged seats and our records showed a woman in that seat assignment. But after I explained what happened; they briefed me on their plan; which was to ASK the unruly passenger to get off first and if he didn't comply; they would ask everyone else to get off then remove the unruly passenger. Fortunately; he walked off under their direction and was taken into the terminal. The flight attendant who was groped was debriefed by operations and company officials and I started coordinating our follow on flight. I called Dispatch on the phone for a new flight plan; fuel request; and other required information. The local operations in PHX were outstanding in meeting our needs and we were back on our way in what seemed like a short amount of time to me. I then made another Public Announcement to the customers about what had happened and that we would be continuing shortly. No one seemed overly concerned to me at that time. My first officer performed exceptionally during this entire diversion and had most of the preflight duties completed upon my return to the cockpit. I downloaded and accepted the new release with our required fuel and we were pushing back shortly afterwards.During the flight; I asked for feedback from my First Officer and the jump seater about what we could have done differently. During that conversation; I realized that I didn't actually declare for priority handling with ATC. I informed ATC of our Threat Level 2 and secure cockpit and intentions to divert into PHX. With my focus on getting down; I hope that information and communications would suffice.Upon a successful and uneventful landing; we were met by an Inflight Supervisor. I thanked my First Officer for all of his efforts and debriefed with my remaining flight attendants in the terminal about what had happened. It was then that I learned about the magnitude of the 'groping' and the horrible actions of the unruly passenger; which only corroborated my divert decisions. I gave my contact information to all of the crew; the supervisor and asked to be updated about any follow up questions if needed.",,,,"An air carrier Captain reported that a male passenger had groped a flight attendant.

As I was descending I saw 4 people getting secondary screening in an area off an elbow in the jet bridge. As I continued down to the aircraft door I witnessed an airport security person escorting a passenger off the aircraft. I was surprised as the plane had been on the gate for nearly an hour; this could not be a passenger still deplaning on arrival. As I entered the aircraft to stow my belongings I noted that the FAMs were already on board. I recognized this as a violation of FAR 121.391; minimum crew on board before boarding. I then went back up the jet bridge to inform our Security/Gate Agent that a person had been boarded without any crewmembers on board. Agent said that they were secondary screening some passengers and that the passenger was not a security issue. In an effort to expedite boarding they were put on the jet bridge and told to wait. The passenger somehow made it down; on to the plane in spite of personnel in place. The CA and Purser arrived moments later and I informed them. The CA discussed the situation with the lead security agent and the purser and it was agreed not to have to re screen the plane to expedite departure.First problem I see is the pressure to expedite boarding to make up for a delay. Second; allowing passengers onto the jet bridge while the plane is being serviced by many airport workers. I assume the passenger saw the FAM's go onto the Aircraft and assumed it was okay to do the same. The airport security person at the door may have thought she was another FAM; or may have been distracted and had his/her back turned as the passenger walked on.",,,,"Air carrier Flight Attendant reported that Federal Air Marshals were allowed to board prior to the crew boarding.",

A female passenger had claimed a male passenger had assaulted her and would not stop touching her. They did not report injuries but requested the police to be at the gate upon arrival. We tried immediately after the call to reach Operations with no answer.At some point during this; ATC issued descend and maintain clearance to FL220. After initiating the descent; the captain resumed attempting to contact Operations. While on the radio with Operations; ATC issued another descend clearance to 17;000 with an expedite descent. I set open descent and read back the clearance. Just prior to returning from speaking with Operations; ATC issued another clearance; this time descend via the STAR. I input 3000 and continued the descent. The captain returned to state he had reached Operations and the police would be present. Shortly after this; ATC instructed us to maintain 13000. I realized we were below the crossing restriction and initiated a climb to 13000. We were in VMC conditions and ATC verified we had returned to descend via clearance and climbed to 13000. No further communication occurred and we thanked ATC for their help.The combination of flight attendants calling; multiple altitude clearances and a brief expedite clearance caused me to forget to set managed descent from open descent upon receiving the descend via clearance. I knew immediately when queried by ATC what had occurred. This was a combination of multiple distractions and varied clearances. Diligence when one pilot is handling a problem outside of normal flight is required. Perhaps once established on an arrival after initial descent expedited descents shouldn't be issued unless for immediate traffic avoidance.",,,,"A320 first officer reported that a disturbance in the cabin caused a distraction that resulted in a deviation from the descent profile clearance.",

That issue was worked out uneventfully; but required a significant amount of coordination. This included the physical presence of the In-Flight station manager; the CSR (Customer Service Representative) supervisor; and the CSR station manager. (I think this is who was present; they never presented themselves in the cockpit.)While the Captain was on the phone with the [operations manager] regarding the care of the disabled passenger; [Flight Attendant] came into the cockpit to report that she had just been verbally assaulted by a passenger calling her an [expletive] after chasing her down the aircraft aisle over a baggage issue. [The passenger] also supposedly shook his finger in her face while calling her that. [Another Flight Attendant] was right behind the passenger when this occurred. I will not include any further details in that regard since I wasn't present and didn't witness it myself. I can say; however; that [the Flight Attendant] was visibly stressed to the point of shaking and expressed that she was not comfortable flying with [this passenger] on the plane. To me this was a clear threat due to the verbal language and physical behavior of the passenger. We did not request any additional presence at the aircraft due to the fact that as far as we knew everyone required was already present.The reason I marked all of the communication issues [is] that at no point during either of these issues did any of the management or CSR representatives at the aircraft attempt to communicate with the Captain. The In-Flight supervisor is the one exception; but that was not until it got to the point of removing either the two flight attendants who had witnessed the incident and were not comfortable flying with that passenger; or the passenger himself. We did have two cockpit jumpseaters; which presented a physical challenge to communication with the Captain. Eventually; the Captain elected to remove the passenger and the whole plane was deplaned in accordance with company policy.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported that one of the flight attendants encountered an unruly passenger during boarding that resulted in the passenger being removed.",

During descent to FL180; ATC issued clearance direct to PLUME to cross PLUME at 9000'. Captain Pilot Flying (PF) programmed direct to PLUME and the crossing restriction of 9000' into FMC as I completed the remainder of my Pilot Monitoring (PM) arrival duties (including acquiring ATIS due to the difficulty acquiring the ATIS via COMM 2 and an ACARS NO COMM earlier in the flight). Approximately ten miles from PLUME descending through 14;500'; as I realized we were high on the descent; ATC queried us due to the high altitude approaching PLUME. ATC then cleared us direct to SARDI to cross SARDI at 7000'; further stating that it had to be a crossing at 7000' at SARDI. Just as the Captain was programming the FMC direct to SARDI to cross SARDI at 7000'; the FMC cycled to the next waypoint and Captain inadvertently selected direct to CCC (the fix after SARDI). As the aircraft began to turn toward CCC; I informed Captain of the FMC programming error. I then immediately selected HDG SEL and set a heading direct to SARDI to avoid a course deviation as Captain reprogrammed FMC for direct SARDI and to cross SARDI at 7000'. When Captain realized the automation would not provide the immediate required descent rate to comply with the crossing restriction; he reduced the level of automation by disengaging the autopilot then autothrottles assuming manual control of the aircraft. Due to the late descent; multiple crossing restrictions and the required descent rate; both Captain and I were well aware the descent was a priority and therefore the speed would be excessive despite our offshore location. Regardless; I advised Captain of what he already knew; excessive airspeed inside 12 miles offshore below 10;000' would and did occur. Crossing restriction of 7000' at SARDI was missed by approximately 500' as Captain attempted to slow aircraft below 10;000' from a speed of approximately 285 knots as we approached the shoreline. Had the Captain not assumed manual control of the aircraft when he did; we would have arrived at SARDI well above the 7500' that we crossed the fix with a potential loss of separation. During landing rollout; ATC issued taxi clearance to exit runway with a right turn on Taxiway E at end of the Runway; which I restated to Captain as I located Taxiway E on the Jepp 10-9. During landing rollout; as I was responding to taxi instructions; we received a call from [the Flight Attendant (FA)] of a Threat Level 1 after a Passenger threatened one of our FA's. Captain answered FA call then made a right turn onto [adjacent] Runway. As Captain turned; I directed him to make an immediate right turn on B3 after I realized where the aircraft was located; scanned the [runway] approach corridor and saw an inbound aircraft on final approximately five miles from the runway. I immediately advised Tower we were exiting [the runway] at B3. Based upon the Captain advising Tower of the Threat Level 1; we required Police to meet the aircraft (as I was determining where the Captain had turned the aircraft on the airport surface since it was other than Taxiway E at the end of Runway [we landed on]). Ground cleared us via any route we selected to the gate. Captain taxied aircraft promptly to the Gate via B3; C and S as I completed the After Landing Flow then contacted operations to advise them we were on the ground and required Police to meet the aircraft at the Gate for a Threat Level 1 Passenger.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported breakdown of automation management and CRM during initial approach.",

Additionally the passenger reported he saw smoke emanating from the overhead panel in the lavatory. Uncharacteristic of him simply smoking in the lavatory; but possibly something much more serious and potentially life-threatening; an actual aircraft fire. The smoke alarm was activated and projecting an extremely loud and piercing tone throughout the cabin. This caused distress among passengers as well as the FA's. Communicating with the FA's over the interphone was very difficult due to the combined chaotic nature of the alarm and the chaos surrounding its activation. The FA's were having difficulty extinguishing the alarm. I did not know if this was due to continued smoke; or some delay in extinguishing the alarm. Our collective belief was the situation could be much more serious. The FA's asked me for assistance in evaluating the situation. I knew my assistance in the aft of the aircraft would be a departure from our standard protocol. However; based on the information we received at the time; I concluded my assistance might very well mitigate a further degradation in the cabin and secure a safe condition as quickly as possible. The First Officer had demonstrated confidence and technical competence; thus I had no reason to doubt her ability to navigate and control the aircraft; as well as communicate with outside agencies while I assisted the FA's with what appeared and sounded to be a rapidly deteriorating situation. In the interest of time and consequently safety; I elected to personally inspect and evaluate the severity of the incident. I did this in order to determine the most expeditious course of action regarding continuing to [our destination] or turning back.As we were mere minutes from the critical point on our flight plan there was only one FA present in the forward part of the aircraft during the time I exited the flight deck. I shut the flight deck door before the forward FA could enter the flight deck. After working with the FA's to silence the alarm and after inspecting the lavatory and it's overhead panel; I determined there was no immediate threat of an actual aircraft fire; as there was no evidence of heat; burning; or residual smoke. I instructed the FA's to lock the lavatory; and reassess every few minutes. After I returned to the front of the aircraft; I established communication with the First Officer via interphone; and advised her I was ready to return to the flight deck; (after approximately 4-5 minutes). The smoke did not continue; so I opted to continue to [our destination]; as long as the condition didn't reappear. For reasons unknown to me; the First Officer left her seat to open the door rather than pushing the unlock button. About twenty minutes later; the FA's found an electronic cigarette in the toilet that was discarded in what appears to be an attempt to conceal its presence and cause for the smoke. After the passenger (who reported the smoke emanating from the overhead portion of the lavatory) was asked about the device; he did admit it was the cause for the smoke and activation of the smoke detector. I felt in the interest of safety; it was best to leave the flight deck and assess the situation personally; and that would be the most expeditious way to evaluate an overall course of action.At no time during the above events did I intentionally disregard standard procedure; rather I utilized my authority as the Captain to bring the situation to safe conclusion while being mindful of [Company policies].",,,,"B737 Captain reported leaving the flight deck to evaluate smoke in the aft lav caused by a passenger's electronic cigarette.",

We were already facing a delay as our flight attendants had not yet arrived. They were coming in on a delayed flight. At departure time we had not yet been fueled so I called operations to advise them of the situation. Fueling began at approximately XB:05. After seeing that fueling had begun; I went up to speak with the gate agent and advise her the fuelers had arrived and to inquire as to the status of the flight attendants. When I returned; I noticed the fueler had only put an additional 2000 pounds on. A few minutes later; fueling resumed. By this time; the flight attendants had arrived and boarding began. The gate agent advised us we needed baggage handlers to load some bags from the jet way. Unfortunately; they were nowhere to be found. Operations could not raise anyone. It took several minutes to finally get all the ground personnel in position. During all this; we had a passenger misconduct issue requiring law enforcement; distracting us further. The whole evening was nothing but distractions. We finally departed at XC:25; 1:45 late. Climbing through 11000 feet msl; we received a FUEL ALT XFR FAULT ECAM. Performing the ECAM procedure resolved the problem. After arriving in ZZZ; we referenced Operations Manual Volume 1 & 2 and upon further review; realized the aircraft had been improperly fueled. The two ACTs (Additional Center Tanks) had fuel in them without the center tank being full. I believe this caused the ECAM.There was a recent change regarding ACT fuel that got overlooked in myriad of unfortunate events that took place that evening. I truly feel it was significant that this flight was scheduled to depart [while everyone was distracted]. No one in Philadelphia had their minds on their jobs. What would have caused the fueler to incorrectly configure the fuel panel and then just leave without telling us? Add to this our inability to locate a tug and push crew; find the baggage handlers; and have to deal with an unreasonable; irate passenger. While we took our time doing the flows and checklist; I completely missed the center tank not being full (it had 7560 in it). There was 3120 in each ACT and considering we were going transcontinental with significant headwinds; I didn't think anything of it.

They told us that he was punching the passenger sitting next to him; hitting the back of the seat in front of him; and also hitting the inside of the fuselage. The captain requested a little more information and asked if we needed to divert. We sent a message to dispatch explaining that we had a situation on board and that we were thinking about diverting. One of the flight attendants called back a few minutes later. She stated that the B was struck by the suspect; and that able bodied passengers were restraining him and taking him to the back row of the airplane.The captain and I discussed the situation and decided that we needed to find a suitable airport to divert. We chose ZZZ and sent another message to dispatch stating our plan. We also [advised ATC]. A few minutes passed and we received a message from dispatch containing [a second release] to our new destination. We landed without incident. The ground crew was waiting for us at the gate. As a result; we were able to get the door open without delay. Law enforcement was also waiting and entered the airplane immediately. The flight attendants made an announcement to all of the passengers that they were required to remain in their seats. She further made another announcement telling the passengers to keep their cell phones put away. I have to say that in retrospect; this announcement was a stoke of pure genius. I was standing in the cockpit door at the time and I didn't see a single passenger capturing video. The offending passenger and his [companion] were removed without incident.On the ground; the captain called the chief pilot duty phone to inform the company while I called dispatch to coordinate our continuing flight to [the original destination]. We were unable to leave right away because the de-ice crew had already left for the night. We had to wait for them to come back out to the airport. I was idle at this point; so I decided to walk through the cabin to see how the passengers were doing. I have to say that I received perhaps 30 compliments on how well and how professionally the cabin crew handled this situation. There were (of course) a few complainers and a few thought we should have continued on the extra 30 minutes to [our destination].Both the captain and I commented that we felt the flight attendants did a fantastic job.

The passenger then went on to tell the flight attendant that it contained medical equipment and that her husband who she was traveling with had a heart blood pump to pump his blood should his heart stop. She gave the flight attendant the attached letter from his physician. The flight attendant was very concerned about this passenger and brought the letter to me. After reading the letter; I approached the lead agent and asked if they had any further information on this equipment. They did not and could not access any information as to whether it was approved for carriage onboard Company aircraft and they called a Customer Service Manager (CSM). I had never heard of this device and accessed the referenced advisory circular. I found out that there may be more than one type of battery used to power this pump and one type needed to [have a] Technical Service Order. I also found out that the passenger had seven such batteries with him. I was unable to ascertain if the batteries were safe and approved to carry. The CSM called the duty CSM who could find no information about the batteries. The CSM got a diagram of the equipment and showed me how it pumped the passenger's blood. He then called Medlink; who could tell me the passenger was okay medically to fly but knew nothing of the batteries and equipment and whether they could fly on our aircraft. He tried everything he could think of but could not get the needed information. I contacted the Dispatch chief on duty and let him know of the situation. He indicated that he would research the batteries in an effort to ascertain if they were approved for us to carry. I spoke with the passenger; saw the contents of the carryon; which was just too heavy for the passenger to lift up to; place in the overhead and examined the batteries. I gave the size; type; volts; etc. to the Dispatch chief. He assured me that he was giving the situation his full attention and would get back to me.Time is passing and one of the passengers began acting out. Although I was trying to keep the passengers up to date; I unfortunately could give them nothing concrete as to the reason and length of the delay. I asked the CSM if there was another flight after ours and if the two passengers with the medical equipment could be accommodated on the next flight; [thus] allowing Dispatch more time to research the batteries and heart pump. He went to handle the unruly passenger who was going down the aisle stirring up the other passengers; cornering one of the flight attendants in the aft of the aircraft and harassing the number one flight attendant for letting the cockpit jump-seater put his crew roll-aboard bag in the overhead when hers was taken away before boarding.The unruly passenger was removed and the CSM assured me the passengers with the heart pump would be accommodated on the next flight allowing us to leave and giving Dispatch more time to make a determination. The passengers in question were okay with that. The advisory circular (attached) did not reference the RTCA/DO-160E stipulated in the letter. The AC referenced RTCA/DO-160D. Is that the same? I still had no information about carrying the seven batteries. I believe at this point; they were lithium ion. Flight Manual has battery guidance but I still could not determine the amount of lithium in each battery.The passengers with the seven batteries and heart pump; I learned later were accommodated on the next flight; batteries were found to be acceptable for carriage. I was delayed trying to get that information. It is not my intention to deny anyone boarding. I just could not determine on my own with the references I had if we could carry the equipment and seven batteries. Apparently; that information was not readily available. I am sure new medical equipment will continue to be presented for carriage. Please publish information about this heart pump and batteries so the next crew encountering it will be able to research it quicker and easier. There was no information about equipment and batteries carried aboard by passengers. Please have information regarding this device and batteries available to crew.",,,,"Captain reported not being able to find guidance information regarding a passenger's portable Heart Pump device batteries.",

Extra fuel was loaded and listed on the flight plan for possible wind-shear and microbursts. We received an ATC reroute while taxing out for takeoff due to storms and traffic in the Midwest. The new route was about 250 miles longer than planned and actually took us closer to the weather forming over Texas; Colorado; New Mexico and Kansas.Once airborne and closer to Denver we received at least 10 different reroutes from ATC. While descending for Denver we were instructed to hold southeast of Denver. We contacted Dispatch and confirmed an alternate plan if we needed one and it was confirmed by Dispatch and us that ZZZ would be the alternate airport if we needed to go anywhere. We asked ATC the reason for the hold and they said it was due to go arounds in Denver. We briefed the ILS to 34R and discussed our approach speed which would be VREF + 20 knots due to wind-shear and reported gusts. Moderate turbulence was encountered on the descent and approach. While being vectored for the approach ATC needed to give us a few more turns due to multiple go-arounds happening. Not once did they mention it was due to microbursts or wind-shear.We were instructed to contact the final approach controller and they vectored us to join the localizer and cleared us for the ILS approach. We configured the aircraft early due to strong tailwinds while descending as well as for the gusts. While on approach I disconnected the autopilot because it was having trouble maintaining the glide slope while staying on speed. We had a momentary flap load relief from flaps 30 to 25. The auto throttles were also disconnected as their performance maintaining speed was inadequate. When we contacted the tower for landing clearance the controller advised us of a wind-shear alert with a 35 knot loss over the runway as well as a microburst alert for 34R. We immediately executed a missed approach and turned to a westerly heading and then subsequently a southerly heading. We retracted the flaps to zero and reengaged the autopilot and auto throttles and speed was selected to about 20 knots faster than clean speed in order to give us some extra time to figure out a plan.The captain assumed the role of pilot flying while I took the role of pilot monitoring. Looking at our fuel and the weather conditions in Denver it was agreed upon to divert to ZZZ. While proceeding to ZZZ at 11;000 ft. We encountered severe wind shear which caused an immediate and significant loss of airspeed which activated a momentary stick shaker. Stall recovery maneuver was accomplished immediately with no loss of altitude or further speed. We then increased our speed to 250 knots. A successful and safe landing was accomplished at our alternate of ZZZ.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737 flight crew reported momentary stick shaker while being diverted to COS after weather caused a missed approach into DEN.",

When I found out about this; the bag had already been removed from the jetway and was in the cargo hold of the airplane. Of course; there was now a problem. I can't have a Li-ion battery in the cargo compartment; and because the gate check bag had left the jetway the only way to get it plane side it per policy (and TSA; presumably) is to send it through baggage claim and the security checkpoint. Unfortunately; I knew of no way around this policy. In an effort to find a workaround; I called the Chief Pilot [who then] consulted with corporate security; and informed me of the following: 'Yes; from corporate security per the letter of the policy; that is correct' [paraphrase begins] However; if you saw fit to look the other way; and have the bag brought up and have the passenger be supervised while their laptop was retrieved; you could be assured that the bag was still safe as was the laptop.' When I asked if I could get either an ACARS message or an email from corporate security stating this; laughter was the answer with a quick dissembling that 'well; no; we can't do that.' And there's your answer. I did get a great suggestion from my First Officer (FO); who suggested that if a TSA person could come down from the TSA checkpoint (about 100 feet from the gate) and monitor the proceedings and rescreen the bag right there; that might be acceptable. While not clearly in the policy; this is a clear way to get the bag screened. The gate personnel informed [us] that this would take way too long; if it was possible at all. As far as I know; no effort was made to try this. (I could be completely wrong here though). At this point; my options were limited. I did; however; have three gate persons (at least one supervisor; and one gate agent; not sure of the third's status) standing on the jetway and in my flight deck telling me that 'we do this all the time; if a passenger accidentally checks medication or needs something else that is time-critical.' Also; I was informed by the gate agents that the baggage hold of the airplane is a secure area; and all of the baggage handlers are 'secure.' The follow on to this is that any bag could go down to the baggage bin and be retrieved. At the end of the day; I had to step off the airplane to force a decision. Unfortunately; the passenger and their bag was removed.",,,,"Airbus Captain reported security issues regarding retrieving a passenger bag to remove Lithium Ion battery prior to pushback.",

He immediately responded that he was a frequent flyer and didn't have to. I asked him politely stating that it was FAR procedure that bags that size be checked (it was over 21 inches in height and rather wide). He got belligerent and said he would be talking to the airline about the poor treatment. I apologized; stating that I was following procedure. He checked his bag and immediately came back saying he was being abused and that I had been yelling at him. At this point; I asked my Captain to see if there was anything he could do to alleviate his mood. My Captain politely talked to him; and the passenger sat down.Once everyone was on board and I got my final; I immediately did my announcements; count; and shut the door. When I did service; I asked him what he wanted and had him repeat it so I was certain I got it right. I then offered him his complimentary drink or snack because he was entitled to it. He got the [snack] box. I finished service; did a trash run; and as I am eating; he ripped back my galley curtain and demanded that I talk to the guy behind him who was rudely kicking his seat to not; because he should be allowed to keep his seat back. I nodded; and asked the guy behind him in [4C] to refrain from kicking him. It was painfully obvious that he wasn't doing it on purpose. The passenger in question was 6'5 and well over 350 pounds. He was just too big for the seat and was pressing against it; because his legs had nowhere else to go. I offered the passenger in 4C a different seat away from him and the passenger declined calling Passenger X an entitled baby and that he wasn't interested in moving for him. I did not respond in any way to the name calling; as I did not want to further gain Passenger X's ire; but I was very polite to both of them. About 25 minutes to landing; Passenger X asked for coffee. I told him we ran out; but offered to make him some. He declined.Other passengers remarked about his rude behavior and apologized to me. I didn't respond because it is unprofessional to do so. One woman told me I had the patience of a saint. Upon departing; he told the Gate Agent that I was drunk and rude. The Gate Agent talked to me and I explained that he was upset with me. She remarked that I definitely didn't seem drunk; just very happy go lucky.I boarded for the next [flight]. After shutting the doors; I started to do my safety announcements. I get a call from my Captain and notice the police are waiting. He had called the police and told them I was intoxicated. I don't drink. I haven't had alcohol in over 20 years. I explain this to the police and give them a statement and all my identification and information. I tell them I will fully cooperate with them and I am willing to give blood; pee in a cup; and take a drug or breathalyzer test. The police tell me I definitely do not appear to be drunk or on anything; but they must do a breathalyzer on me to document it. I absolutely complied immediately. I am given a breathalyzer and it comes out 00. The police apologized and I immediately go back to work.I will say that I am absolutely distraught that I was put in this situation. I am a very energetic and enthusiastic individual when it comes to doing my announcements. I am disheartened that my manners were misconstrued in anyway as I try to be as completely professional and polite to everyone I meet. I usually have a great time with my passengers and they always come out of my plane with a big smile on their face.

Additionally; customers seated in the same row of the reporting customer in 23F; as well as in 22DEF reported similar observations. FA (Flight Attendant) stated she briefly observed smoke in a formation she described as similar to cigarette smoke. I responded to the incident location to investigate. Upon arrival; I did not observe smoke. However; as I approached 23F; I detected a faint odor consistent with electrical combustion. Based on my observation and the statements of the aforementioned customers and FA; I made the decision to deplane all customers. I then contacted [Maintenance] and briefed the Maintenance Controller of our status and concerns. Upon arrival; a Maintenance Technician initiated a smoke and fume investigation of the aircraft.

Since the reporting customer was seated in 23F and we were concerned about property belonging to and stowed under 23F by the customer assigned to 24F; I initially contacted and interviewed the customer assigned to 24F. I introduced myself and explained I was concerned for her safety; as well as that of the entire flight. I observed she was in possession of a backpack. I asked her where her backpack had been stowed and what items she had in her backpack. She stated she had stowed beneath 23F; and; that among other items; it contained an e-cigarette; but stated she had turned it off. I asked if she would voluntarily open her backpack. She answered affirmatively and did so. As I looked inside her backpack; I detected an odor similar to the odor I had detected during initial investigation in the incident location of the cabin.

As we were discussing this a [Supervisor] comes down to the airplane and told us that the man in question had been communicating with the airport police and the airport police told the [Supervisor] that the passenger in question was not intoxicated; but had been to detox and that was why he acted differently. With this information in hand we saw no reason for why he should be denied the flight. We depart with no issue but halfway through the flight we get a call from one of the flight attendants. The passenger in question had become unruly and had asked for alcohol. He said that if he did not get alcohol he could have a stroke. At this point the FA call was more of an informational call to keep us updated on what was going on in the passenger cabin. 10 minutes later the flight attendant called us again using the emergency call button and then tells us that the passenger stood up and was interfering and was pulling his shirt off. He had also earlier expressed to the passenger next to him that he was considering suicide. As we understood it during the call there was a dead heading pilot and passenger that helped to restrain the passenger.  After the flight attendant call we expeditiously diverted to ZZZ. Authorities and medical assistants met the airplane. The passenger was taken off the airplane. Unruly; unpredictable passenger.It is a hard call. The police said he was not intoxicated.

All passengers in that area responded with a verbal YES that they are willing and able to assist in a possible evacuation. Then; I moved to brief the forward over wing exit seats. When I asked for a verbal confirmation that they were willing and able; the man in seat F said NO. Then; his wife hit him and told him he was supposed to say yes. He quickly corrected himself and said YES; explaining he couldn't hear me over the music. The lady in seat C said she could hear me both times when I briefed and she has a hearing aid. I was concerned he wouldn't be able to hear Flight Attendant commands during a real evacuation; so we talked about the exit doors and I asked him questions about the doors from the briefing. He did not seem to understand or hear me well enough to carry a conversation from 3 people away. I told him no problem I can reseat him in an available aisle seat. His wife got upset and asked me why several times; and they told me they would not move. They became very combative and argued when I answered their questions.I needed to finish my briefing and asked the rest of the passengers in the row if they were willing and able and everyone else said YES; except a man in seat A who said I DONT KNOW and he doesn't understand how the door operates. I explained how to open the door and referred him to the safety information card and directions on the exit door as a visual reference. He asked me where the life vest was and seemed confused what to do. I told him it was under the seat. He had his hands out in front of him and shook them like he didn't understand. I told him no problem we have another aisle seat he can sit in that would make everyone more comfortable. Neither man would voluntarily move seats; even when I hit the call light and got help from [another Flight Attendant]. At this point; the fact that they could not follow flight attendant directions concerned me more in the event of an evacuation. Together; [the other Flight Attendant] and I went up to the forward galley to ask for a Supervisor and talk about the situation as a crew. When the Supervisor arrived; she asked me where the passenger was and I walked her out to the row and showed her the two men. She asked them if they were okay to sit there and then told me we're good.

The main door was closed and the jetway was pulled from the gate. A female passenger wanted to deplane. I called Operations and informed them we had a passenger that wanted to deplane. The jetway was pulled up and the passenger deplaned. Before the jetway pulled up; the passenger was exhibiting erratic behavior and wasn't sure if she wanted to stay on the airplane or deplane. She also switched seats on the aircraft. She told the Flight Attendant in the front of the airplane that she was homeless and had nowhere to go when she got to ZZZ1. I thought that was strange in and of itself. She (passenger) then said she needed her checked bag; but then decided that it was ok if her bag went to ZZZ1 and she didn't. Again; a very strange request from a person who just said she was homeless.The Flight Attendant didn't know her name because she had switched seats along with other passengers. The flight was half full. I was then queried by the ramp personnel if I had her name and checked bag tag ticket number; so the bag can be pulled from the cargo hold. I did not. I did not have her name and the Flight Attendant did not either. There was a [few] back and forth [between] Ops [and] the ramp personnel to go without her and keep the bag on the aircraft. [However]; the Ramp could not locate the bag because they had no ticket number or name. At first; they wanted it removed and then they didn't. At this point; I didn't have the passengers name and neither did the Ramp or Operations. I was not comfortable keeping the bag on the aircraft not knowing the passengers name and her erratic and inconsistent behavior.At one point; I was told by Operations that she was a fare jumper and it was okay if her bag went to ZZZ1. I informed Operations I was not sure what a fare jumper was and I would like the bag removed because there was just too many inconsistencies with the passenger's story and everyone's inability to produce the passenger's name. I only found out from ground personnel [her] last name. I then looked up the passenger's last name and I was able to produce the name for this report and the aforementioned.While the Company Operations Manual states that a passenger's bag can travel without the passenger domestically; there were too many unknowns with the passenger and I exercised Captain's authority and had the bag removed. I was being asked by Operations to depart and they assured me it was okay to go; but yet could not produce the passenger's name. That was not adequate for me. Captain's authority in this situation was crucial to making a last stand for a passenger exhibiting erratic behavior and a very inconsistent story for her wanting to deplane. It is paramount that Captain's authority be maintained to avoid the loopholes and the willingness of Operations to get the aircraft off the gate ASAP. I felt it was a safety issue and I was not comfortable keeping the bag on the aircraft.Any passenger who is unsure about boarding the aircraft should be met by the Ground Crew Security Coordinator.",,,,"Embraer ERJ Captain reported that a passenger deplaned and wanted to leave the luggage on the aircraft.",

Agent said 'He is a very big guy; who had outbursts in the waiting area. He was told to sit down and wait quietly. This passenger is traveling with his family; (mother; grandmother and another female) he may have some mental disabilities and we gave him the last row of seats 33D;E;F. He should be fine to fly.' He also stated that he had not interacted with the passenger and was relaying the message from boarding agent.Crew asked to speak with boarding Agent that had interacted with [the passenger]. Boarding Agent stated that while in the airport lobby [passenger] was pacing and projected to his mother 'Mom do I need to take my medication.' Captain advised the agents to contact Medlink regarding medication concerns as well as the stability and suitability for safe travel. Agent returned with a printed medical release stating passenger was on schizophrenia medication from personal doctor and Medlink said he was cleared for travel.C FA (Flight Attendant); takes out flex cuffs and leaves out for flight in aft galley; A FA does the same in forward galley. (prior to taking off).When passenger boarded the A FA was asked by [passenger] where his seat was. A FA escorted passenger toward last row. This was at the end of boarding so the overhead bins near row 33 were full leaving [passenger] to stow his bags at 25ABC. [Passenger] could not understand why his bag needed to be stowed away from his seat and would not take direction from A FA. [Passenger] yelled to his mother seated at 32D to move several times. After explaining multiple time that there wasn't room he finally placed bags in overhead.B FA; Briefs 2 ABPs (Able Bodied Passengers) to assist if needed. (Prior to take off).[There were] multiple outbursts and incidences throughout the flight left Captain mapping closest airports and peeping for threat levels. [Doctor on board] Believed that [passenger] was in a manic state of his Schizophrenia. Doctor offered to sit with [passenger] if needed. [Passenger] had multiple outbursts during the flight including storming up the aisle yelling at a passenger seated around row 22-24. Yelling at people who were waiting to use the bathroom. Yelling for people to put on seatbelts. Stating that he didn't like blondes. Stating he didn't want D FA to come near him. Became more aggravated if his family talked to him *This is just to name a few*.As a crew we defused many potential situations during the flight which could have escalated quickly. I honestly don't think we could have put flex cuffs on [passenger] without being seriously injured. The fact is; we took out Flex-cuff restraints and prepared ABPs before we even left the ground because of Medlink's clearing an unstable passenger to fly.  [Passenger] is currently an unstable passenger who should not fly without an advocate able to defuse potential escalation of his diagnosis and can restrain him if needed.Our crew handled a situation that didn't need to exists. [Passenger] needs more assistance than family traveling with him for future travel.Cockpit interaction as follows:We were brought into the matter prior to boarding when the A FA said we needed to hear what they had just learned about a passenger. There was little to go on at first until we were able to talk directly to the agent that had witnessed the behavior. As soon as I heard that the passenger was on medications I asked the agent to contact Medlink to make an assessment.  The agent returned with a photocopy of a letter from a Doctor authorizing the passenger to travel and a report that Medlink cleared the passenger to travel. None of the crew had seen the passenger yet and we were informed that the passenger was traveling with his family but that he 'didn't like them'. We had a crew brief regarding the situation and came to a consensus that we were ok with the passenger travelingbut that we were going to take precautions. I asked the crew to be vigilant and to think in terms of Threat Levels. I also encouraged them to call us at anytime there was a problem including below 10;000 feet.  Upon boarding the passenger; the A FA got my attention to see him. He was in his 20's to 30's perhaps but well over 6 feet tall and of medium build. Another brief with the crew for selecting ABP's.As can be seen in the previous narrative; there were several incidents that generated calls to the cockpit. While each of them was diffused; the atmosphere for all of us was that of a ticking bomb. It wasn't 'if' but 'when' for the 6 hour flight. While the crew was handling the various events in the back; [First Officer] and I briefed likely Threat scenarios and divert locations. As we approached [destination]; I sent a message to Dispatch advising of passenger situation and the need to have Supervisor meet the plane. Upon radio contact with [destination] I confirmed they had been informed by Dispatch and that a show of force was not a good idea due to passenger's size and seating location in the rear of the jet. No further incidents after landing. Crew debriefed with Supervisor and Agent.The post flight debrief gave us the opportunity to review what we did and what we would do in the future. Crew worked well together but came to the conclusion that we would not put ourselves in that situation again. Had it not been for Medlink clearing passenger to fly; he would have been left at the gate.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported that a passenger who was approved to fly displayed disruptive behavior before and during the flight.",

Several passengers concerned that he stowed his bags and exited immediately (especially [passenger at specified seat]; who actually wrote a report of his own). I got off the plane called the agent she had him in her sight said he needed WiFi. I told her he just exited a secure area and can't just exit for WiFi. She tells me; (he's an [airline code for passenger awards]) and she had him in sight. To my understanding [passenger award customers] follow the same security protocols. She put him in the jetway. He took a seat on an aisle chair opened his laptop; set up a makeshift work station in the jetway; made phone calls and etc. and refused to come in when we tried waved him down. Meanwhile the Captain boards in street clothes/no briefing. Just gives his name. Passenger questions his identity. I ask the agent about him boarding in street clothes and she said she checked his badge. He proceeded to change in the cockpit. I tell him my concerns; I have never been on this plane and it doesn't have a key pad; what's the door access procedure. He tells me he's also never been on this plane he flies [another model]. We decided on calling and knocking. As far as the passenger who breached security; he says; can you live with him on the jetway for 10 minutes. I thought it was dismissive. Later the passenger boards; I explain that what he did was a breach of security and he can't run off a plane without acknowledging the crew. He boldly tells me I'm wrong several times. He tells me secure area is anything after security. He can then do whatever after that and often does as he flies often. No sir; the plane is the prize and this is the secure area. He continues to tell me I'm wrong; meanwhile the airplane door was shut by the agent without acknowledging me or my crew. I asked the Captain to address the situation with the passenger. Again he seemed to be put out. Told me I was right. Asked me if it mattered. I said yes; it matters to me. He asked me the seat number.

I briefed and directed all flight attendants to remain seated until I called to allow them to begin service. I also reviewed the [turbulence guidance] commands and procedures with all flight attendants together. This occurred in the [gate] jetway prior to boarding the airplane and was driven by the unusual [local] weather.Pre-departure passenger announcements. I personally greeted the passengers in first class and explained directly the flight attendants would delay their service to them as much as 20-30 minutes. I made a PA announcement to the entire airplane while standing near Row 1 so all passengers could see me. During this welcome announcement I stated; 'When I turn on the seatbelt sign; I'm serious! Don't get up. If you wake and see the sign is on; stay seated. This is for your safety and the safety of my flight attendants.' This announcement is standard for me; and I vary it only as conditions differ from flight to flight.Departure. My FO (First Officer) and I tuned the radar on to view activity to the east while holding short RW XXR. We both varied the tilt and range and concluded we didn't see anything significant in our path out to 160 NM. Turbulence was light to occasional moderate throughout the departure; and we noticed most of the buildups were absent from radar and could see nothing of concern throughout the turn to the east.We were filed 27;000 initially; but ATC advised the smoother rides were higher. We requested 35;000 based on reports and airplane performance. Light and occasional moderate turbulence remained throughout. At level off; we continued to individually assess radar and limited visual cues for storm position; height; and intensity. ATC offered direct ZZZ1; but I declined the offer until we could confirm this routing with dispatch. Based on tilt position and visual cues; it appeared all storm activity was below 35;000 by more than 5;000 feet. However; performance allowed 36;000 so requested and were cleared block 35- to 37;000. We climbed to 36;000. Rather than engage Econ Climb/Cruise; we selected speed 280/.76. The event. At one point the air began to smooth; but could see there was one line of storms remaining. I made the PA announcement for everyone to remain seated and warned we have another set of bumps to pass. As we approached the weather; it appeared to have 'exploded' in front of us and I thought we would be right at the tops. However; within seconds we were completely engulfed and turbulence increased to continuous moderate with occasional severe. I monitor the flight attendants on the interphone routinely. At this time the FA (Flight Attendant) at 2L called the Purser and advised her a woman got up to the lavatory. She also stated that they yelled at her it wasn't safe and to return to her seat. However; the woman continued to the aft lavatory. While she was in the lavatory; turbulence shot up to continuous severe and I disconnected the autopilot to maintain pitch and power (auto throttles remained armed; but I physically guarded them). Airspeed fluctuated from stickshaker to clacker; and altitude dropped to as low as 34;800 feet. Event seemed to last two minutes or more. Once we exited the weather; I confirmed with flight attendants they were good and asked the status of the passenger. They reported they were fine; but the passenger suffered a cut to the forehead. When it was safe for any medical help to leave their seats; Purser requested passengers with medical training to identify themselves. A fire battalion chief and family member fire paramedic responded to the call; treated the woman; and fed information to me that I passed to Medlink. Two male passengers also complained of neck pain. Medlink recommended three Tylenol for each passenger and one Benadryl for the male passenger who vomited. Note: neither Tylenol nor Benadryl are labeled as such in the medical kit and caused confusion to the flight attendants. It took about an hour from the time I could allow first responders to leave their seats to the time I was fed information to pass to Medlink. After several frequency attempts to contact dispatch through ARINC; Medlink confirmation to continue and offer the medication was finally received. Medical personnel met us at the arrival gate and escorted all three injured passengers off the airplane.",,,,"B737 Captain reported severe turbulence as well as issues with the medical kit used to administer first aid to passengers injuries.",

Bearded and wearing what appeared to be biker leather vests and one of them dropped the f-bomb while laughing and walking down jetway. At this point I thought they might have just been enjoying a few drinks in the bar while waiting on our two hour delayed departure; but was not very concerned since nobody else was in the jetway.  Agents were very motivated to try and turn the aircraft quickly to salvage connections. Told First Officer that biggest threat right now was the the time pressure being applied. To mitigate that we would take our time and methodically accomplish preflight items and checklist and go only when we were ready. They agents were pushing to get everyone boarded and door closed asap. As boarding was concluding (last 10 passengers boarding); the lead FA (Flight Attendant) advised that we might have a problem. Two individuals with military ID's had boarded early and appeared to be intoxicated. He was not sure if this was going to be a problem? Shortly thereafter; the other FA came up to express that the passenger in XXC who boarded early was slurring words and potentially disruptive. He was concerned that this individual might become problematic during our 3+hr flight and wondered why agents had boarded passengers in this state. I asked them if they were comfortable and they hesitated in responding so I asked to have CSR (Customer Service Representative) go back and assess condition of passengers. If he was intoxicated then I conveyed we would not be taking him. While agent was going back to check on passengers; held further discussions about pitfalls of taking passengers with First Officer and FAs. Also contacted [company] to briefly advise of situation. Agent returned to cockpit; and provided update. I conveyed that we would like passengers deplaned based on his prior actions and statements and concern expressed by FAs. At this point passengers came from XXC to front of cabin. As agents and FAs were talking with him to essentially convince him why he should deplane; he asked to speak to the Captain. I could see the situation escalating from my seat and cell phone cameras were coming out. I told FA or CSR that I'd be happy to chat with him in the jetway but not on the aircraft. He declined that invitation and refused to get off the airplane. At that point the decision to remove him from the flight was clear. The friend who was traveling with him (XXC had told FAs the other gentleman who boarded with him was his brother; but we later learned this was false. They had met in the bar approximately 4 hours prior) was able to convince him to deplane. At some point during this event the CRO (Complaint Resolution Official) showed up to deescalate the situation and was apparently met with resistance by one of the CSRs. passengers voluntarily deplaned and we pushed and departed. [Later] Dispatch asked us to come up on Commercial Frequency.

After about 20 minutes I got out of bed and got dressed and went to front desk to request a room change due to noise coming from next door room. I was told that the hotel was full and no other rooms were available. I advised that I would need to check out and go to another hotel if they were not able to accommodate me with a suitable quiet room.The hotel desk person then offered [another] room. I went to the room; unpacked; and went to bed at XB:30. At XF:00 I was woken by noise that sounded like a squeaky door being opened and closed repeatedly. I assumed it was the person in the room next door and that it would eventually cease upon their departure. The noise began at XF:00 (3 AM my body clock time) and ended up persisting into the afternoon.I tried to ignore the constant cadence of the noise that was occurring several times a minute. I was now completely awake; so I got up and went downstairs and had breakfast. I returned to my room and attempted to acquire some type of rest; but with the persistent noise; this was not possible.I made a call to the front desk complaining about the noise and that it was interrupting my sleep. I was told that they would look into the source of the noise.A few hours later; I got out of bed and went down to the front desk to inquire if they had any idea of what was causing the noise. As it turned out; my room was directly above the kitchen. Additionally; there was also an employee maid service door close by my room on the second floor; but I was not able to determine the source of the noise. The noise was clearly coming from some type of squeaky service door in the kitchen or elsewhere near my room where employees were constantly in and out through the door.I again returned to my room to try to gain rest; but the noise was still persisting; so about an hour later I had one of the hotel representatives come up to my room. [Hotel rep] brought a maintenance person with him and they both were able to hear the noise in the bedroom; but were unable to identify the source of the noise. They said they would look into it further; but the noise never subsided.I reported for my flight feeling somewhat compromised with not being able to get quality sleep. The flight was delayed due to ATC flow into ZZZ. We had been fueled to max tank fuel at the gate; but this still didn't allow adequate fuel to ZZZ due to enroute head winds combined with weather and delays at ZZZ. Additionally; the ZZZ forecast for our time of arrival showed a wind shift at ZZZ and that they would be landing south with forecast thunderstorms. I spoke with the Dispatcher and told her that the planned arrival fuel was not adequate and she concurred. A fuel stop was then planned and I advised I did not receive adequate rest to do a fuel stop and then continue to fly a second leg to ZZZ where there were delays and weather with landing RWY XXL. I spoke with a Dispatch; Operations Manager; and then later; Chief Pilot (s). Both Chief Pilots were in agreement to have me fly to ZZZ1 and then re-crew with a Captain. Upon arrival into ZZZ1; I called in fatigued and another Captain was placed on the next segment to ZZZ. The flight to ZZZ1 was busy with planning to get our landing weight below max gross and performance limits due to full tank fuel and a full plane of passengers. Initially we were planned to fly Cost Index 10 and to bump about 25 passengers; but this still did not allow adequate fuel upon arrival at ZZZ and we were still going to misconnect most of our passengers due to ATC flow. The preflight flight required multiple calls; with Dispatch on the ground trying to get numbers to work in order to be able to try to be able to operate the flight nonstop to ZZZ. Once that was determined to not be an option; we then looked at doing a fuel stop [at an alternate]; but that wouldn't work due to being over max gross landing weight because of the boarded max tank fuel. Then; [a second alternate] was looked at; but the flight wouldn't be able to be re-crewed with a new Captain; so ultimately ZZZ1 was chosen. I made a taxi error in where I turned on Taxiway E instead of F to get to C while taxiing to runway because of my being less than mentally sharp at that point. The taxi error did not result any conflict and we turned onto taxiway C and continued to [the] runway.We flew to ZZZ1 at FL220 to burn enough fuel to get below max landing weight. Multiple ACARS communications transpired with Dispatch regarding weights; routing; turbulence; and altitude.At top of descent; a Flight Attendant notified us that we had a passenger issue where passengers were complaining about smelling smoke in the cabin which turned out to be a passenger that was smoking in the lavatory on several different occasions during the flight; so that issue had to be addressed and resolved during the descent while at the same time we were trying to determine landing performance data because of encountering icing conditions in the descent along with setting up for a bleeds off landing due to being performance limited.By the time we arrived ZZZ1; I was very tired and not able to select Fit For Duty to continue the next leg.This was not an ordinary; everyday flight with all of the factors involved with it being a fuel stop with a 737-900ER where we had to make sure we were below max gross landing weight along with being below performance landing/go around limits.Another Captain was in the jet bridge waiting to take the flight to ZZZ; so there was no delay in re-crewing a new Captain; however; the next leg from to ZZZ incurred a flow delay on the ground in ZZZ1. I went to the hotel at ZZZ1 Airport; checked into a room exhausted and went to sleep. Thank you for your time in reviewing my Operational Fatigue report due to hotel conditions which created a fatigue situation where I was unfit to safely operate a second flight late into the night and early into the morning into ZZZ with weather constraints.",,,,"B737NG Captain reported calling in fatigued following a poor night's sleep in a noisy hotel.",

I decided to go up front and check on her. When I arrived; she was on the phone with the pilots. When she got off the phone; she showed me her water bottle and it was a milky cloudy substance that had a strange odor I had never smelled before. I advised her that when we land she needed to complete [a report] and call [company operations center]. She said she felt fine and didn't think it was necessary.Later in the flight; the C Flight Attendant went forward so they could let the pilots out to use the lavatory. A few minutes later; I was paged over the PA to come forward. I quickly went to the front to find 2 passengers and the C [Flight Attendant] in the front galley. I saw that the A [Flight Attendant] was laying on the jumpseat. I sat her up and asked if she had any allergies and if she was taking any medicine. She said [drug] and then her eyes rolled back and she fell back again. The C [Flight Attendant] paged for medical assistance and a physician came forward with his medical license card in hand. I verified and allowed him access to [the C flight attendant]. He used the EMK to check vitals and was going to initiate an IV for fluids to help bring her blood pressure down. However; the A [Flight Attendant] came around and was able to talk with the physician. The pilots attempted to establish a patch with [Airborne Medical] but were unsuccessful. The physician recommended that the A [Flight Attendant] remain seated and try to relax for the rest of the flight. We relocated the A [Flight Attendant] to seat 1C and she remained there until we arrived at the gate in ZZZ.The physician remained in close proximity of the A [Flight Attendant] should her condition deteriorate in the remainder of our decent. I asked that the C Flight Attendant begin to close down the forward and aft galley while I went and collected medical notes and gathered relevant information from the A [Flight Attendant] as well. The C [Flight Attendant] and I agreed and advised the pilots that I would remain forward and occupy the 1L inbound jumpseat for landing and the C [Flight Attendant] would occupy the aft jumpseat for landing. The pilots advised that EMS would meet the flight upon arrival.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported that another Flight Attendant became ill after consuming a cloudy drinking water.",

While trying to figure out exactly what was happening and trying to figure out coordination with Ops; the passengers deplaned. Not being able to detain [the] passenger [since] the passenger left. I called Hazmat to have them dispose of the waste and scrub the galley. I also coordinated with Ops to get everything replaced in the galley. We were ground delayed 15 min in ZZZ waiting for a wheels up. I turned off the fasten belt sign and told everyone feel free to use the bathroom while on the ground.

First passenger was seated in 8C with cabin pet in carryon kennel. Second passenger was 25A with small dog tucked under her coat. First Animal; [seat] 8: [The] dog remained in kennel for entire flight and did not cause disruptions. However; what caught my attention during boarding was passenger had to swap seats (at my recommendation) with 9D due to 8C's kennel unable to fit under her seat. The kennel was blocked due to the IFE power box under 8C. It should also be noted that PETC [Pet in Cabin] was not discovered as undocumented until inflight; thus ZZZ ground staff was not alerted about this animal prior to departure.Second animal [seat] 25A: Requested [passenger's] seat number as she boarded since I had not noted no pets on the Special Services List during preflight briefing. As boarding continued; I refreshed my Flight Attendant tablet to check if passengers with dogs were a last minute add to the manifest. However [passenger] was checked-in but no reference to ESA or SVAN [Emotional Support Animals and Service] on The Tablet seat map. Also; [I] referenced a fresh copy of the Special Services list no documentation.  I then contacted the female gate agent via phone and advised that we had a passenger with an undocumented cabin pet aboard while providing seat assignment. Prior to door closure; I witnessed [customer service representative] come onboard and question [the passenger].  I overheard him asked what type of service passenger's animal provided. The passenger responded; but I was unable to hear her answer. Later noted after landing that passenger's PNR had been updated reflecting her dog was a medic alert animal -- thus making it a SVAN. However; the dog had no exterior badging; vest; harness; or leash to keep the animal under control during the flight. The passenger simply cradled the dog in her arms during the flight.  As noted in the FA Inflight Manual; SVAN are to remain on leash or harness under passengers control at all times for safety.The main focus of this report is to express extreme concern on how two animals: 1 PETC and 1 SVAN were permitted to board the flight completely undetected by the ZZZ ground staff. Of even greater concern; PETC was in cabin kennel during the boarding process thus clearly visible to agents working the flight. Further; SVAN was permitted in the cabin without the correct restraint thus creating an injury risk to passengers and crew.Report filed due to personal safety/injury risk to passengers/crew with dog permitted to board without proper restraint requirements (leash/harness/vest). It also appears this animal was not correctly documented as a SVAN due to last minute add to PNR.",,,,"B737-800 Flight Attendant reported 2 dogs being brought onboard without proper paperwork or notification from the gate agent.",

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him. I am not Management; I do not get to have a say in how our passengers are handled.

The passenger was informed to take a seat at mid to aft cabin due to distribution on the 800 aircraft; stating there is plenty of overhead bin space at the back for his carry on that seemed a bit large for the more narrow/less deep bins up front. The passenger snapped at the D Flight Attendant indicating that he was going to do what he wanted to do.Flight Attendant D recognized that the tall male passenger sat in the OWWE (Overwing Window Exit) Row. As the D made her way back she stopped to see how the passenger was doing. He was glossy eyed and loud. Flight Attendant D inquired if he had been smoking and under the influence of a substance. The passenger replied 'Yes; all day long.'  Flight Attendant D clarified if he were referring to Marijuana? The passenger replied 'Yes; I voted for it and I have been smoking all day long. We just signed a deal...' Then showing his logo/ clothing brand.The D Flight Attendant congratulated him on his business dealt then proceeded to inform the B Flight Attendant of the concern having a person under the influence of a substance in the OWWE. The B Flight Attendant concurred stating that 'Under the influence of a drug/marijuana is the same as alcohol.'The D Flight Attendant informed the A Flight Attendant of the concern then went up to the forward galley to discuss with the A [Flight Attendant]. The C Flight Attendant conducted the OWWE brief.The A [Flight Attendant] proceeded to talk to the passenger. The D Flight Attendant informed the flight deck both Captain and First Officer. No verbal response was given to the D Flight Attendant from the flight deck.The A Flight Attendant informed me; the D Flight Attendant that the man was okay.The D; said 'No he's not - he is admittedly in front of many passengers; I can smell the marijuana; under a controlled substance; approved use in Captain is only for use in the home and at a minimum he should not be in the OWWE; if even on this plane however even people who smell as if they've been drinking are not to be allowed to board.' The A Flight Attendant responded by saying; 'I spoke to him and leaned in and could not smell it.'Later the B Flight Attendant stated that he appears under the influence of marijuana/a substance and is eating a lot of pretzels; referring to the munchies.Later the C Flight Attendant stated that he (C) 'Heard how the passenger was talking to the D Flight Attendant and told him to settle down.' As the D Flight Attendant - the C heard that the passenger said he had been smoking marijuana all day long why was he allowed to remain in the overwing window exit?I think the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) needs to clarify the term 'Intoxicated' to define if it only refers to alcohol or any substance to include marijuana; meth; speed; cocaine. Particular clarification is suggested with respect to marijuana as it is now legal in many states. However I don't think those laws supersede federal law or Federal Aviation Regulations. I think that the flight deck/ops made an error in allowing the passenger to remain in the OWWE; even if they wanted to approve a stoned/person under marijuana passenger to be able to remain on the plane. I think the fatal error was made in saying 'The A said the passenger was okay. 'If the A Flight Attendant has the final say then please clarify for crew.  The C and B Flight Attendants are still on probation and the A has not been flying too long. Being able to answer a question 'Yes; I will help' is not very reassuring when someone is under the influence of a primarily illegal substance even if it is legal in some states. It is a known fact that reaction time and mental processing of information is delayed under the influence of marijuana and other drugs; legal or illegal.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported that a person under the influence of marijuana was allowed to remain seated in the emergency aisle after admitting being under the influence.",

I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him. He admitted to using a vape pen but said it was not marijuana. He said he could not find said vape pen. Ultimately he had to be let go for no evidence. As passenger was walking away; he [waved] good bye to police and the vape pen fell out of his pants. He was taken into custody and I wrote a police report. The vape pen was tested positive for marijuana. Passenger also admitted to smoking in the cabin during his interrogation.",,"Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.",

We knew that a change of aircraft was going to take place as well as a crew swap with new flight attendants once we arrived in ZZZ.While the passengers were deplaning from the flight [to ZZZ]; I elected to deplane and move to the other plane at the other gate.When I arrived at the gate the gate agent was frazzled; and came to me stating that she started boarding the [next] flight without the pilots because the flight attendants were there and ready to bring passengers on the plane. I said that is fine; but then she said that she stopped boarding because one of the passengers opened the over-wing exit door. I told her that it was good to stop boarding; and that I would make an announcement to the passengers in the jetway; and on the plane to move back to the boarding gate area and off the plane. I made an announcement to all the passengers in the jet-way to head back to the boarding gate area. Once on the plane I asked the forward Flight Attendant what happened and she confirmed the gate agents' words. As I looked back to the aft Flight Attendant; she looked worried and not happy. I immediately made an announcement thanking the passengers for their cooperation and informed them that we would need to deplane and take all of their belongings with them back to the boarding gate area. I related the need for safety and that an inspection was needed for the over-wing exit door by a qualified maintenance individual. Everyone deplaned and then I was able to move to the exit row; see the over-wing exit door sitting on the seat; and get the complete story from the aft Flight Attendant in the presence of [a Company staff member] from ZZZ.After hearing the cause; I called Dispatch; and had them stay on the line as we spoke with Maintenance Control. We spoke with [Maintenance Control;] and informed them about what happened. He said that an inspection was needed and a possible pressurization check might need to happen. He coordinated local maintenance from ZZZ; and I went to the Gate Area to let the gate agents and the passengers know what was happening; and that this might take a while to complete. I also reiterated the importance of safety; and that this kind of behavior was not acceptable; and how it impacts everyone; passengers; crew; and others at other airports. All of the passengers were thankful and many shook my hand. When local maintenance arrived they inspected the door; and relayed to me that a pressurization was not needed. They signed to maintenance log and we proceeded to [our destination.] The flight attendants did not want the passenger or the passenger's friend on the flight. She mentioned this in front of the [Company staff member]; and he mentioned that they were already removed from the flight; and mentioned that they might be on the 'no fly' list moving forward. I agreed with not letting these 2 individuals back on the plane; and I fully supported the flight attendants' wishes.All passengers deplaned and I moved to the exit row where the Flight Attendant and the [Company staff member] were waiting. I saw the exit door sitting in the seat. I asked her what happened and she explained.This report from the Aft FA (Flight Attendant) [describes the cause:]There were 2 guys that boarded the plane and it appeared that they were in the bar before the flight as it was delayed. They were loud and talking back and forth. One of the passengers was approximately 2 rows forward of the other sitting in the exit row. He mentioned 'hey dude you are in the exit row;' and the other said 'ya; I am going to keep you safe dude. I have got this and it is my responsibility to keep everyone safe on this plane; man.' At this time the flight attendant came forward and said; I am glad that you are taking your responsibilities seriously in the exit row. She was doing this to confirm that she was hearing slurring words coming from this man and she wanted to be closer to him. Immediately after she said this to him he said; 'oh; ya; I got this; I know exactly what to do.' Immediately he pulled the exit door handle and removed the over wing exit door. This all happened while the FA was saying 'Nooooooooo!' At this point she told him to put the door on his seat and remain there. She called the forward Flight Attendant and let her know what happened and she informed the gate agent to stop boarding immediately.I came on the plane shortly after this. Both FAs did not want these 2 individuals on the plane due to safety concerns and I agreed.",,,,"CRJ-900 Captain reported being informed during passenger boarding that a passenger opened the Emergency Overwing Exit door.",

[Flight attendant] confiscated the cigarette and went to the restroom to extinguish. I told the guest that they cannot smoke on a plane. He informed me that it wasn't his fault and that he did it while he was sleeping. I then confiscated his lighter and told him we will return it when we land and he deplaned. [Flight attendant's] got and presented the disturbance report to the guest.  He was very antsy and would stumble like a zombie to the restroom multiple times before we even performed service. We did not smell any alcohol; I thought maybe he had taken a strong sleeping pill. As the flight went on and after the cigarette incident his behavior became more erratic in being up and about. Even though he had used the restroom at least 15 times he would stumble to the back struggling to find the restroom and door handle. He even would try opening other galley structures. After the incident we as a crew felt it unsafe to leave our doors and had to be vigilant of the guests movements at all times. We had to move the guest seated in 23 A; she felt very uncomfortable and was on edge about the guest. 23 F stumbled and shoved a guest waiting in line for the restroom 9C. I said something to 23F and there was no comprehension of what he did and he just stood there like a zombie. A guest in 29 F was uncomfortable with the guest's behavior and discussed it with me.

He  announced the he was a One K; he paid our salaries and would sue us and the airline and have our jobs if he was not served. The purser stated that he felt unsafe and wanted this passenger off the airplane. I felt that at this point it would be better to talk to the purser face to face. I hung up the phone and went to the aft galley where the purser was trying to separate himself from the passenger to deescalate the situation. He repeated the story which was confirmed by an additional flight attendant. While they were relating the story the passenger entered the aft galley. I turned to the passenger and told him he needed to return to his seat. He demanded a 'double whiskey!' I continued to tell him he had a choice to return to his seat or he would force me to divert the aircraft. He demanded a double whiskey and started to bow up and flex his muscles. Fearing a physical escalation the purser grabbed me by the shoulder and moved me away from the passenger. Leaving him with the other two flight attendants in the aft galley. He continued his demands and threats. I returned to the flight deck with the purser and we discussed our options including dispatch on the satellite phone. The consensus was we did not want this to escalate. We coordinated a divert with ATC and dispatch. We dumped approximately 10;000 pounds of fuel. Once the cabin was secured I made an announcement that we were diverting at which time the passenger hid in the lavatory for a period of time.

After the completion of boarding and just prior to main cabin door closing; the ramp closed due to thunderstorms and lightning in the area. This ramp closer dragged on for nearly three and a half hours. During which time several PA's were made and a few passengers elected to discontinue their journey to ZZZ1 and deplaned. The flight attendants followed their ground delay procedures as well. The flight finally pushed off the gate at XE:30 but unfortunately after engine start; we received a REVERSER light on the number 1 engine. We coordinated with Ground Control to remain parked on Taxiway A abeam [the] gate. We advised ZZZ Operations that we needed to return to gate; they advised us to contact Maintenance who then in turn advised us to contact [Maintenance Control] who then directed us back to Maintenance. This all seemed convoluted while sitting on an active taxiway. At XE:50 we blocked back into [the] gate; by which time the ramp closed again due to lightning.It was decided to deplane the passengers while waiting for Maintenance. The passengers showed some frustration and a few were grumbling over the ongoing delay. The airplane was fixed; reboarded and blocked out for ZZZ1 a second time at XG:57; six hours past the original scheduled departure time. While enroute; the flight was placed into a holding pattern for thunderstorms. While holding; the Captain coordinated with Dispatch to change our alternate to ZZZ2. After 40 minutes of holding and an ATC extension to our [estimated critical fuel] of an hour; it was decided to divert to ZZZ2 where the plan was to refuel and continue to ZZZ1.By the time we arrived in ZZZ2; a cell was moving closer to the airport with increasing winds and gust. The approach into ZZZ2 was normal but light to moderate turbulence with a 30 kt. crosswind. The Captain and I were informed by a Flight Attendant at the gate that there was a group of passengers in the back of coach starting to get rowdy and a lady was yelling that the landing was horrible and that the pilots must have been drunk. However; prior to the gate arrival; we had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes to park due to ground equipment inside the safety area of the gate and our ground personnel was unable to move. Touchdown in ZZZ2 was XK:10 and block in time was XK:54.At this point a few more passengers elected to discontinue the flight to ZZZ1 and deplaned. We did refuel and was ready to depart once again for ZZZ1. The flight attendants did inform us that the passengers were beginning to reach their boiling points and showing frustration with all the delays beyond the weather and storms. These passengers were starting to get disruptive; but to my knowledge; still compliant. We blocked out again at XL:34 and given an EDCT (Expect Departure Clearance Time) for ZZZ1 of XM:05. We reached a holding area near the runway; still not receiving a closeout from Company; a call was made to Operations who informed us that they were 'working on it'. Several more call were made to Operations as we approached our EDCT. Still no closeout and since we missed our XM:05 EDCT; a new EDCT was given of XM:17. Several PA's were made to keep passengers informed. The flight attendants informed us the passengers were getting more frustrated and more vocal over this ongoing delay.Several more calls to Operations were made and they informed us that because this was a diversion flight; they were having trouble reopening the flight to enter the closeout data. I guess I don't understand this statement; were we the first diversion ZZZ2 has ever seen and were we the first diversion that needed a new closeout in ZZZ2? If not; they sure acted like it was. Needless to say; we now missed our XM:17 EDCT and given a new EDCT of XM:55. A PA was made to keep passengers informed but the passengers had had it. They reached their boiling points; becoming disruptive; very vocal; and wanted off the airplane. We decided to coordinate with Dispatch a return to gate due to the escalating situation in coach. Prior to the gate return; we did finally receive our closeout but it was too late. The flight attendants informed us the situation was starting to get out of hand and we needed to get on a gate. While taxing back to the gate; I thought I overheard a Flight Attendants call another Flight Attendant on the intercom to inform her she overheard a passenger tell another passenger that they were going to 'kick her ass'; referring to one of the Flight Attendants. Since this was now approaching a level 1 threat; we asked for several Supervisors at the gate as well as a police presence. We blocked back in at gate at XN:05; a full 11 hours after this nightmare began; and deplaned. A Flight Attended informed us that a passenger flipped her off while deplaning.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported due maintenance issues and weather causing them to divert the flight was delayed from its planned destination 11 hours at which point passengers became disruptive and demanded to be let off the aircraft at the diversion airport.",

I told her to remain seated because we were troubleshooting a problem. I then made a brief announcement to passengers that the Flight Attendant would remain seated until we reached a higher altitude. Shortly thereafter; I received a call from the cabin; but it was from a passenger that had picked up the cabin phone. They told me that the Flight Attendant wasn't getting out of her seat when they pressed the call button and that they heard a thumping sound from the airplane. I told the passenger to hang up the phone. I then made a PA to the passengers telling them to remain seated with their seat belts fastened and that we were troubleshooting a problem that was causing the thumping sound and not to be alarmed.

Aircraft was in motion backing out of gate area; when non-rev passenger from XXA yelled out to non-rev passenger XXD to move to her open seat next to her. So non-rev passenger XXD moved as I'm telling her no and shaking my head still she continues to move back the seat in XXC. I met up with the non-rev passenger as she sat down and informed the non-rev passengers that I will have to tell the Captain that you have moved seats and this might cause a delay. Told Captain and he said OK and the flight went on normally. Sterile light came on and made announcement for final walk through the cabin. A parent was waiting for his child to exit the aft lav. Child came out and told me that the sink was spraying so I looked and the water in the sink was coming out of the faucet on the mirror and back wall. So I reached over to turn the knob when it fell off the wall and water came shooting out of the wall at me and I tried to cover the spray with my hands but I was overwhelmed and the spray started to heat up. Shutting the lav door to avoid the water. Made a loud noise and started flowing like a river out of the bottom of the door. I instructed my other Flight Attendant to call the Captain. I opened the galley bins with the napkins and towels that we have and threw them on the floor but the water was to overwhelming and the landing gear was down. The water overflowed into the aisle and 6 rows of seats; as the plane tipped forward the water became a river and made its way down the aisle I saw passengers' bags in their laps to avoid the water and had said over the PA that a stream of water was making its way to the front of the aircraft. The water made its way to the cockpit door and the whole front galley was in water. We landed and the fire alarm had sounded in the aft galley. The Captain called and asked my other Flight Attendant to check the back lav to see if there was smoke in the lav. She had checked and said yes. Captain instructed me the take a second look and I went rushing down the aisle; opened the lav door and looked in to see that the water was not shooting out as bad as before and that there was steam and no smell of smoke. I told that Captain and we were headed to the gate. I sat back in my jump seat in the front and I called my Flight Attendant and instructed her to grab the fire extinguisher if an electrical fire were to break out during deplaning and check the lav periodically to see if the steam dissipated. We arrived at the gate and started to deplane. The disruptive non-rev passenger decided to block the aisle at the main cabin door to tell me how unprofessional I was when they had moved seats earlier to sit next to each other. Captain asked her to move so that passengers could exit the aircraft due to the damage and not knowing if a fire would break out. She decides to lean into the front galley to inform me that she used to be a flight attendant and her niece is a flight attendant with [Company] and will be informing her of the mistreatment that I had done to her. I told her she jeopardized her safety along with other passengers' safety when she decided to move during the taxiing of an aircraft; she walked away without any other word. All passengers deplaned safely. Passengers' child detected the leak. I and other flight attendant saw as well and it went from there.",,"I was in the aft galley with FA (Flight Attendant) A when 2 PAX - a dad and daughter - came up to use the restroom. The daughter was the only one who went in. When she was in the restroom the FO (First Officer) came on the speaker and began his initial descent announcement. FA A began his initial descent announcement right when the FO finished. Right as FA A finished his announcement the daughter comes out and mentions to her dad and myself and FA A that the sink isn't 'turning off'. We tell them we will see what's going on and they can take their seats. FA A went into the restroom with the door open and we both observed water spewing from the faucet and spraying the windows. FA A went to turn the nozzle when the whole nozzle came off and the sink water came out shooting like a cannon. FA A took the damage of the water and we immediately closed the door to prevent it from hitting the back row passengers. After closing the door we could hear a loud whooshing of water coming out of the sink that the aft passengers realized what was going on. I picked up the phone and called the pilots to let them know what was going on while FA A tried to get napkins to stop the water from leaking to the rows but the stream was coming too strong. Since we were already descending to ZZZ FA A and I did final compliance checks before taking our jumpseat. That's when I noticed the aft lav smoke detector was sounding off and the pilot called quickly to ask if I could identify any smoke or odor coming from the aft lav. I opened the door and the lav had a fog to it but no odor. FA A quickly came over to double check and we determined no smoke was happening from any electrical failure but was the steam from the hot water that the sink is capable of since the aft lav smoke detector would turn off after a couple of rings and then turn back on when a few minutes passed. As we approached landing I noticed the water was starting to slow down but still flooding. Once we landed the pilots called once again to make sure no electrical fire was happening since the aft smoke detector was still going off and I kept checking to make sure no fire was happening as we began to taxi to the gate. I take out the halon just in case but did not break the seal. We get to the gate and deplane with no more further incident.",,"EMB-175 flight attendants reported that in addition to an unruly passenger while boarding; there was a malfunction of the AFT lavatory sink; allowing water to flow forward to the cockpit door.",

After loading the bags; [Passenger] boarded the airplane with his wife while [Pilot] and myself made small talk with him. During this conversation; he mentioned he was a pilot and his personal airplane was in the shop. He also mentioned he was running behind for his trip. He made a comment to 'Just fly straight north around Tampa and Orlando's airspace and we'll be fine'. At the time it was a casual 'pilot to pilot' comment and had a non-serious tone. We chuckled it off and replied that we will just have to do whatever ATC tells us.I gave [the passengers] a safety briefing. After which he commented that he has never received one before. I explained to him that it was required before every flight. I then entered the cockpit and completed the before start checklist with [Pilot]. Once the engines were started and avionics powered; I attempted to contact the published clearance frequency on the ground. With no response from either clearance or departure; [Pilot] and I concluded that the weather and airspace conditions were safe for a VFR departure to receive the clearance in the air. Once airborne; I attempted to contact the published Tampa departure frequency; again with no response. Shortly after I tried an Orlando approach frequency that did respond and gave us an IFR clearance only a couple minutes after being airborne.Because of the nature of the airspace; traffic; and receiving an airborne clearance; we received delay vectors toward the east. These turns caught [Passenger's] attention and he came up to the cockpit shortly after leveling off at 10;000 feet. He asked in a much more stern and serious voice this time why weren't going north; repeating the same comment he said before departure. [Pilot] handed the controls off to me and explained thoroughly what was going on and that we will be on course shortly. During this time I was occupied complying with ATC instructions and may have missed small details about the exchange. Shortly after we are cleared on course and begin climbing to cruise.Moments after we reach our cruising altitude of FL400; [Passenger] again comes up to the cockpit; verbally upset about the minor delay and wants to know how much longer. I hand the radios off to [Pilot] and remove my headset to talk to [Passenger]. I told him we will have about 35 minutes remaining once we accelerate to our cruise speed. He demands that the 'Hobbs should be rolled back' because we didn't take his suggestion and that we should have done what he said. I explained to him that we had no control over the situation and we as a crew have the authority over the aircraft's flight path. At this point he is becoming verbally demanding and beginning to make [Pilot] and I uncomfortable. He continued with the comments about altering the flight time records and I tell him several times that he can contact the company with any concerns as to not escalate the situation. [Passenger] went back to his seat and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.[Pilot] and I discussed what was happening and we determined that he fits the criteria for a Level 1 security threat. After shutdown; [Passenger] and his wife exited the aircraft as we unloaded baggage and they went about their way. Once the post flight duties were complete; [Pilot] contacted flight control about the situation as per the actions outlined in the FOM. I should also note that [Passenger] was drinking alcohol throughout the flight provided by [Company].[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly on [Company] aircraft; as another crew may take his suggestions seriously or have the situation escalated further.",,,,"CL-604 flight crew reported an intoxicated passenger disturbing the pilots during the course of their duties.",

Winds were called at 320/23G33. There were current reports of significant windshear on final with winds shifting from a tailwind to a headwind. Just below 1;000 feet; the amber WINDSHEAR warning was displayed on the PFD and shortly after the airspeed increased significantly enough to destabilize the approach and I made the decision to go around. Because of the significant storm sitting in the path of the missed approach procedure we had precoordinated with Tower that we would be turning east away from the storm in the event of a go around. During cleanup and climb out with the sudden increase of airspeed the flaps speed limits for flaps 30 were exceeded with a top speed of 173 knots. We were offered an approach to [Runway] XXL at ZZZ which we initially accepted but requested to hold so that we could properly set up for the approach while at the same time approach control advised us of the winds (which were still the same) and were out of limits. We elected to hold on the final approach course to the RNAV XXL and wait to see if the storm causing the effects would possibly move out. While holding I asked my Relief Pilot to coordinate with Dispatch if ZZZ1 could be used as our alternate considering that I would need a maintenance flap inspection and I knew that ZZZ1 maintenance personnel were highly experienced with the 767 fleet. We were provided both ZZZ2 and ZZZ1 information. Our filed alternates were ZZZ3 which was in the path of this storm and ZZZ4 which was on the other side of the line of storms. Dispatch was in concurrence and we obtained clearance to ZZZ1. We were subsequently cleared to ZZZZZ4 arrival. After departure from holding; I asked my First Officer to declare minimum fuel until landing. We were offered our choice of runways and landed on [Runway] XYL. Our parking location given was Spot X. We could not locate that on any JEPP chart and ended up asking Ground Control if they could tell us where Spot X was. They also did not know where Spot X was nor did our Ramp Control. Ground Control eventually found out and gave us taxi instructions to a remote; uncontrolled location on the west side of the airport. We parked the brakes and shut down. I began making DOT announcements; notified [Maintenance Control] thru Dispatch of such; and attempted coordinating with [Company] Ops for our maintenance needs. No one came to the aircraft or brought airstairs. One hour later; we were assigned Gate X (international gate); and had to restart engines and taxi back across the airport. Final parking time after an additional 30 minute [for] jetbridge malfunction was. I continued DOT announcements (excluding the opportunity to deplane because Customs and Border Protection would not clear anyone to leave the aircraft.) Coordination was accomplished with Maintenance and other [Company] ground personnel for us to begin the preflight process to return to ZZZ. As we waited for Maintenance sign off; with the cabin temps rising I continued announcement updates trying to coordinate for ground air support. As the 4 hr DOT deadline approached; I was advised by the cabin crew that the passengers in the back of the plane were becoming unruly and angry in the over 80 degree temps. Water services had been made as well as delay snack kits exhausted. The logbook was not here yet and I did not know how much longer; but ground personnel advised that 'it was close'. At that point; we were also approaching our MOT and I made the decision to terminate the flight and attempt to deplane the passengers. I continued status announcements awaiting Customs and Border Protection's clearance to deplane. During this additional wait; I was given reports of passengers fainting and children with bloody noses. Not knowing how much longer it would be before release by Customs and Border Protection; I asked the [Company] Agent to please call for paramedics to tend to the passenger health issues being reported.  Customs and Border Protection released the passengers at approximately 4.5 hours after landing at ZZZ1. Flap over speed was caused by extreme weather anomalies. The DOT exceedance was directly related to inadequate support by Ground Personnel.",,,,"B767-300ER Captain reported the DOT passenger ground time limit exceeded and a flap over speed..",

At that point; two Ground supervisors came aboard and talked to the passengers. The supervisor told the crew that he discussed the matter with the couple and they agreed to adhere to C.F.R(s).The child was buckled in and the plane took off. Once in the air; the child remained in the seat belt throughout the flight. A follow-up call was received from [the company] Supervisor. She explained that there was a new directive coming from Headquarters and that once we inform the passenger that they should buckle their child during takeoff and landing but we are not to enforce C.F.R. It would be to the parent's discretion if the child should be buckled on takeoff and landing. She explained that passengers could perceive themselves as being 'bullied' if they are required to follow these regulations and procedures. Our focus is on hospitality.

Unbeknown to either of us flight crew; she had the roller skates in her backpack rather than a carry on. She took her seat as I pulled the cart back to the galley; and my other Flight Attendant kindly convinced her to return to her normal footwear. She assisted her with the removal of the roller skates. The passengers that assisted the UM during service were given complimentary beverages as a gesture of gratitude. There were many concerns as to why she was flying alone. It was very difficult getting her to understand the safety briefing; why she had to remain seated; and keeping her from getting off the plane without a gate agent. She was weighed down with a backpack including the roller skates; as well as a carry on. She tripped multiple times over her luggage on the ramp. She refused to allow anyone to touch her bags.

I observed the passenger standing by door 1L for a few minutes and he was acting oddly; would not make eye contact; wearing mirrored sunglasses in a dark galley. His carryon bag seemed somewhat empty from a distance to be traveling internationally. The gate agent opened and closed 1L to remove passenger. I asked FA B what seat the deplaned pax was in to verify with operations and dispatch that the correct person was removed to get accurate final weights again.

I made a PA; announcing we had security issue requiring the aircraft to be re-screened which would take approximately 30-60 minutes. I also indicated that we had extra fuel on board to make up some time and we were initially planning on a 45 minute early arrival; so hopefully; we'd be only slightly behind schedule. I instructed passengers to stay near the gate since we would board immediately after the issue was resolved.I spoke with the [Flight Operations Manager]; the ZZZ CP (Chief Pilot); ICE Agents; [Police] responders and [Air Carrier] TSA (Transportation Security Administration) Liaison. My initial concerns about the deplaned passenger behavior elevated when I learned he was traveling with others and they were airline employees. I began questioning what type of screening they were subjected to prior to boarding our flight. Concern focused on how they entered the secure area; via an employee line; a modified screening procedure for their airline in another terminal or normal TSA screening. My primary concern was the deplaned passenger might have left something for the others to use as a weapon.GSC was impressive; they deserve recognition as do all the others involved for their professionalism and understanding that our concerns were legitimate. They quickly and thoroughly performed the security sweep. Once the aircraft was secured; we began boarding and all passengers were grateful we had exercised caution with the security of the aircraft. We coordinated with Dispatch for a faster flight plan; confirming the required fuel was already on board for the new flight plan.Prior to departure; we learned from the ICE Agents; the deplaned passenger was displaying abnormal behavior because he was lying to the FAs about his actual reason for deplaning. ICE Agents ran his information which came back unremarkable; but they said he'd changed his story a few times with them and the [Police] upon their arrival. Eventually; he stated he was anxious about flying; did not know what 9/11 was and would nothave got off had he known how big of a deal it would be.I questioned myself several times during this process; wondering if I was overreacting to my instinct about the deplaned passenger behavior and the laundry list of unanswered questions. Ultimately; I made the decision with the support of everyone but one person; to do the safe thing and delay the flight for a thorough security sweep for any contraband that could be used as a weapon. I had just briefed the crew of the significance of the date and to perform their duties diligently and report anything they thought was out of the ordinary. I emphasized cockpit door procedures and relayed there were no known threats to our flight; but to remain vigilant.I'd like to commend everyone in ZZZ involved; thankfully the outcome was uneventful as one would hope; although an experience I will never forget.",,,,"B767 Captain reported security inspected aircraft after passenger requested to be removed from aircraft prior to departure.",

According to FA-B; the passenger had entered the aft lavatory carrying a jacket with him. The passenger had been in the lavatory for more than 10 minutes and flushed the toilet over 10 times. I contacted the CA (Captain) and informed him of the incident and the suspicion that the passenger was vaping in the lavatory. The CA informed me and [FA-B] that he was contacting the ground crew in ZZZ to report the incident.I made two announcements: one stating that the seat belt sign was on and any passenger away from his/her seat should return to their seats immediately and fasten their seat belts; the second announcement reminding passengers that smoking and using e-cigarettes and vaping is not allowed in the cabin and lavatories per federal laws. [The passenger] returned to his seat within two minutes. The CA made an announcement prior to landing requesting all passengers to remain seated until a GA (Gate Agent) boarded the aircraft to resolve a minor issue. I followed with an announcement stating that exceptionally on that flight; the fact that I would get up to open the door was not a signal that passengers could get up and that they should wait until the GA came aboard and after he/she left.While the GA dealt with the passenger in the cabin; the law enforcement officials asked me if the fire alarm went off and I responded that the fire alarm did not go off. They asked me if either FA actually saw the passenger vaping; I responded that we did not see the passenger vaping; informed that the lavatory had an odor familiar with vaping products. They also asked me if we had a witness; and I responded that we did not have a witness. They informed me that they could not do anything without any of the answers being positive. They advised that the GA could speak and warn the passenger; but law enforcement could not approach the passenger without solid evidence. The GA later reported that [the passenger] said that the reason he was in the lavatory for an extended period of time and flushed the toilet multiple times was due to the fact that he is Muslim and he was doing an act of purification.",,,,"EMB-175 Flight Attendant reported a passenger suspected of vaping in the lavatory.",

About halfway through the flight a woman from 2C comes and sits on my jumpseat and states; 'my husband is a pilot here. Do you know Captain XXX?' I reply; 'no.' She continued. 'He always tells me about medical emergencies and I know all the procedures so I wanted to let you know my mother's oxygen level is 58% saturation right now. She needs oxygen.' I asked background information including how she knew the saturation number; was the patient on any meds; and if she was traveling with a POC (Portable Oxygen Concentrator). The daughter became very indignant. She finally responded NO she didn't have a POC; was not on any medication; and her mother has a monitor for her saturation levels and she was concerned about blood clots. As I reached for the oxygen I asked why she did not alert us of this potential problem when she boarded. The daughter became irate; asked for my name; and said this never happened before. I gave her my name and spelled it and proceeded to tend to her mother at her seat. I stayed with her mother until her oxygen levels began to rise. Within minutes her oxygen saturation raised to 98 percent but her pulse was 107. I asked if she needed a cool compress or if there was anything we needed to do to lower her pulse. She stated no; her mom was fine and just needed another couple minutes to relax and breathe deeply. The patient remained conscious and talkative throughout. Was never in any pain. Did not lose color; was not feverish or flushed. After another couple minutes the pulse went down to 85 bpm and I went to the galley to call the Flight Attendants in the back and call the Captain. I gave the Captain the details. 78 year old woman who initially had low oxygen saturation. Captain asked if the passenger had a POC; why she was not traveling with oxygen if this was an issue; and why we were not made aware upon boarding. I let him know that those questions upset the patient's daughter. I asked how much longer we had in the flight and he replied 1.5 hours. He told me to let him know if she went into a second oxygen bottle. As I was hanging up from the Captain; the elderly passenger from 2D rushed to me and said the oxygen bottle wasn't working. I went to the ill passenger and found the daughter turning the oxygen off while complaining that it isn't working. I turned the bottle back on and asked her not to touch it as she is not a Flight Attendant. I pointed to the expanded oxygen bag and let her know that indicates a working oxygen bottle. I asked her to again check the oxygen saturation and it was 97%. The daughter stated that her husband is a pilot for us and doesn't like when they have to divert for medical emergencies so she didn't want to say anything during boarding. I went to grab my iPad so I can begin getting information for the airnotes. The daughter came to the galley again to thank me for my help and again asked my name. I again gave it to her and started asking her information to fill out the form. She said; 'I don't have all that information; I don't know her that well.' Confused; I tried to clarify; 'I'm sorry did you say this is your mom?' The daughter again became irate and screamed; 'I JUST MET HER 6 MONTHS AGO! This has never happened before!' I inquired as to why her mother had a monitor if this is not an ongoing issue. She responded; 'well this has never happened in the air before!' I went to the ill passenger to get information directly from her. The daughter gave me her mother's name but in her phone she was listed with a different last name. The daughter let me see the phone to copy the phone number; and an address. I also took the daughter's name as a witness).I asked if the mother was on medication. The daughter said no; then said she was diabetic. I confirmed; 'is she on the medication insulin; then?' The daughter said; 'well yea I guess she is on medication.' I asked when she'd taken insulin and was told about six hours ago but her blood sugar was fine and she wasn't on any other meds. The daughter was not sure about allergies. I asked if the mother was on oxygen regularly. The daughter said no. The mother chimed in that she was given oxygen before departing but didn't think she would need anymore. The daughter then replied that she thought that would be enough oxygen to make it through the day. The daughter again stated that her husband hates to divert for medicals and that she is live texting him as the situation is unfolding. I collected all the information on the airnotes and again went to make the Captain aware of the additional information I'd received. He asked what the minimum saturation should be. I asked the patient and she said it should not go below 88%. We kept watch to make sure it did not go below that again. I asked the pair if they wanted paramedics called at the moment and they responded no. I asked if they wanted paramedics to meet the aircraft; they responded no. I called the Captain back to let him know the response and that we would keep her monitored. We hung up and the daughter again came to my jumpseat. She said she wanted my name so her husband could write a thank you right now since he is already on the ground. I gave her my name again and spelled it. I could see her phone as she typed in my name and a text from her read; 'I am so pissed at this flight attendant right now.' She typed in my name and sent the message. I pointed to the message and read it to her and asked; 'is that the thank you?' I immediately picked the interphone back up and let the Captain know that she was repeatedly using her husband as a threat as I try to fill out my report and care for her mother. Not long after; the pilots asked to come out for function breaks. I told the Flight Attendants in the back what was going on and we all decided it was best to have paramedics and a supervisor meet the flight. Pilots were on board with that and made the request. When the first O2 bottle got to 500psi I changed it out and we sat early due to turbulence. Before we sat I had the daughter check her levels. Saturation at 99% and pulse at 78%. When we got to the gate the paramedics took her off in a lift chair and tried to chat with the patient. The daughter emphatically refused all assistance. The paramedics left and the airport service coordinator radioed that he was not going to ask for ID or any more information because they were not allowed to do anything and he walked off. The patient's personal wheelchair was brought up and an airport pusher took her to baggage claim. I would like a response from the chief pilot regarding the behavior of the Captain and his wife. I would like it noted on the Mother's profile that she cannot travel without adequate oxygen. I would suggest that Captain and his wife have their flight privileges suspended due to ongoing threats; interfering with crew duties; and putting the crew (and company) in a situation that could have resulted in a diversion due to withholding pertinent information and providing untruths while we were trying to assess the situation and give adequate medical care.

I heard the dog barking from row 8; so I went to the back to ask what was going on. The passenger had a pet. The B Flight Attendant noticed the pet on the seat. She explained to him that the pet was required to be in its carrier and under the seat during all phases of flight. He told her that it was just going to bother all the other passenger and continue to bark the whole flight if he did that. She told him that was airline policy and the dog needed to remain under the seat. He told her that the dog does this every time and of the last 12 flights; only one other crew made him do that. Well; our crew followed policy; and reminded him that the pet needed to remain in the carrier and under the seat. The dog continued to bark; he put in ear plugs; and all passengers around him began to get even more angry. About 2 hours into the flight; multiple conversations and continued barking; another passenger said she was going to have a panic attack because of the dog and if it didn't shut up her husband was going to kill the dog. We tried to move her but when we found a new seat she didn't want to move. At this point the dog was removed from the carrier and placed on the passengers lap. We informed the Captain of the situation and told him we would need a Supervisor to meet the plane. The passenger was very polite; but also frustrated at this point; as were we all. I walked back to his seat and the dog was on the tray table at this point. I didn't want him to be blindsided by a supervisor meeting the plane; so I explained to him that someone would be meeting the plane to talk to him about the situation. He was very understanding and knew he was not following the procedures we have for a pet. The woman sitting behind him told me that we should have just looked the other way and not worried about what he did with his dog. I explained to her that was my job and I'm required to follow procedures and policies set in forth by the airline. She then told me to stop worrying about my job and just leave the dog be.I told her a supervisor would be meeting the plane if she needed to talk to anyone. When we arrived there was no supervisor there to meet the plane. I had multiple people asking to speak with someone. Our Captain called 2 hours out; and again 20 minutes out. And still no one was there to assist. We finally got to the end of deplaning and the passenger walked off with his dog in arms; right as a supervisor finally showed up. When we asked about waiting for a supervisor they told us that all they were told was that it had to do with an animal and they had more important things they were taking care of. Consistency from all crew and the airline needs to be placed. We have rules for a reason and I'm sick and tired of being the bad guy for enforcing the rules.

As I was doing my final walk through; I gave the passenger count to the 'B' Flight Attendant; and noticed that her galley was not secure; nor was the 'B' seated in her jumpseat. I did not address the issue in an effort to avoid crew conflict or micromanaging my coworker and continued to secure the cabin area of the final walk through. 	Before takeoff as the 'C' Flight Attendant and I were securing the cabin and I was finishing my final walk through; we came upon a passenger seat back (Row 1; aisle seat) obstructing egress of passengers into and out of row 2. I observed the male passenger positioning his feet on the bulkhead wall and reclining in the seat. For the safety of the passengers in row 2; the 'C' Flight Attendant and I asked the male passenger to raise his seat back to its upright and locked position. The male passenger pushed the button and the seat returned to its upright and locked position. He then positioned his feet on the wall and pressed his bodyweight against the seat back forcing the seat to recline beyond its natural upright and locked position again obstructing the egress into and out of row 2. I informed the passenger that if he continued to press against the seat back in that manner; the seat could potentially break. The passenger then sat up in the seat and the seat back remained in the upright and locked position. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I allowed the male passenger to remain in the seat for takeoff because we made the assessment that the seat was fine without malfunction. Before landing  during the securing the cabin process as I was finishing my final walk through; the 'B' Flight Attendant galley was unsecure and she had made her way to the front of the cabin. I double latched all of her compartments; except I left the coffee cup that she had on the counter and the full coffee pot and warmer on. I asked her if she wanted the coffee left in the coffee pot and she said; 'Yes.' I continued my walk through and secured myself in my jumpseat knowing that the 'B' Flight Attendant galley was not secure nor did I observe the 'B' Flight Attendant being secured in her jumpseat in an effort to avoid crew confrontation even though this disregarded in flight policies and procedures for securing the cabin during the final walk through. The 'B' Flight Attendant had walked with the 'C' up to the front of the aircraft. The 'B' Flight Attendant was now sitting on the front jumpseat where the 'C' Flight Attendant should have been secured at this time. Again; I observed the male passenger in row 1 forcing his seat to recline beyond its natural upright and locked position obstructing the egress into and out of row 2. I instructed the passenger to return the seat to its upright and locked position. The passenger was agitated and aggravated over my request and stated that the seat would not stay upright. I instructed the passenger to sit upright in the seat and press the button. The passenger complied and once more the seat was positioned perfectly in the upright and locked position without obstructing row 2. The passenger then immediately placed his feet back up on the bulkhead wall and forced the seat to obstruct row 2. I address the male again and inform him if he can't stop the seat from obstructing row 2 then it is broken and I would have to move him to another seat. The 'B' Flight Attendant; while sitting on the front jumpseat in clear view and hearing range of all passengers; verbally challenges or chastises the 'C' and me regarding the seat back. She asked if the passenger pushed the button to recline the seat. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I were trying to inform her that there was nothing wrong with the seat. The 'B' Flight Attendant kept aggressively and loudly stating that the seat is broken and that almost of the seats on the plane was like that does that. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I kept trying to tell her that was not the case. The 'B' Flight Attendant just went on a loud rant talking to us and the male passenger saying if the seat is reclining that far back and he is not pressing the release button; then the seat is malfunctioning like most of the seats on the aircraft. The 'C' Flight Attendant and I continued to try to explain and reason with her; but failed all attempts. I then said; 'Okay; thank you. We need our jumpseat now.' I then opened my garbage bin to throw away the collected trash and used gloves. During this time; the 'C' Flight Attendant informed me that the 'B' Flight Attendant walked over to the male passenger and stated as a one on one conversation where other passengers could hear; 'It is not you. It is the seat.' As the 'A' Flight Attendant; I felt in the best interest and safety of all passengers and liability of [Company]; I had no other choice; but to move the male passenger to another seat (Approximately row 5 or 6 window seat).At the gate; the Captain sat in the seat.

After about 20 minutes of taxiing; I completed the before takeoff checks which includes a PA requesting the flight attendants to 'please be seated for departure.' We were number 2 for takeoff when suddenly we received a cascade of various EICAS messages. These included WINDSHEAR INOP; GPWS INOP; TERRAIN FAIL; E1 SHORT DISP; and RAD ALT 1 FAIL. We advised ATC that we needed to leave the queue and taxi somewhere to work on the problem. The Pilot in Command then contacted Maintenance and worked with them by phone on troubleshooting. In the meantime I advised the flight attendants that we were working on a problem and that we weren't sure yet if we'd need to return to the gate or not. I remained on Comm 1 in order to monitor ATC while the pilot in command was on the phone with Maintenance. It took only about 10 minutes to troubleshoot the issue. By this time it was around 30-35 minutes since we blocked out.After being unable to resolve the issue; Maintenance advised us to return to the gate. The Pilot in Command then made two separate PA calls to the passengers. The first PA call was made immediately after Maintenance told us to return to the gate. The second PA call was made a few minutes later as we taxied back to the gate. The Pilot in Command apologized to the passengers for the problem; explained that we tried to resolve it; but unfortunately needed to return to the gate for further inspection. Due to the heavy congestion on the airport; it took a while to return to the gate. We blocked in about 1 hour after we first blocked out. By this point everything seemed routine.However; upon arriving at the gate; two passengers became extremely irate. One in particular was the passenger sat in seat 1A. This passenger said he had 'two million miles' and promised 'to report the crew to the airline CEO for not communicating any information to the passengers.' They also stated that they did not appreciate 'waiting for over an hour on the airplane with no information'. We only knew of the problem for 10 minutes before making the decision to return to the gate and making our first return to gate PA call.This passenger's aggressive behavior rapidly became very erratic and it visibly upset our flight attendants. The anger that this passenger was expressing did not seem proportionate to the issue at hand. The Pilot in Command then got out from the cockpit to talk to the passenger personally in an attempt to deescalate the situation. Unfortunately; there was nothing the Pilot in Command could do to calm this passenger down. The gate agent eventually came down the jet bridge and we the crew remained on board the airplane for our own personal security. At first we were worried that the Pilot in Command's PA calls were not being heard; hence why the passengers felt they were left in the dark. But both the flight attendants as well as a deadheading pilot confirmed that there were indeed PA calls made that were loud and clear. We believe that the passengers were under the mistaken impression that the delay we experienced taxiing to the runway was the result of the maintenance issue; whereas it was due to normal delays at Newark.After deplaning the gate agent advised us that this irate passenger 'had left and was nowhere to be seen.' It was assumed he left to catch another flight. Because of this information we did not feel it was necessary to advise the gate agent to deny re-boarding of this passenger. However; after Maintenance resolved the issues and we began re-boarding. We were surprised to see that the same passenger was back and ready to take his seat. He was the first one to board no less. We then paused boarding to discuss this situation with both the flight attendants and the gate agent. Our primary concern was to ensure that the flight attendants felt safe. Although she was initially hesitant having this passenger on board she ultimately did agree that she would becomfortable with this passenger on board. The Pilot in Command then had a word with this passenger before he took his seat. The passenger was noticeably more calm; which somewhat assured us that he would not be disruptive again. We assured the flight attendants that if this passenger were to become disruptive after the main door was closed that we would promptly return to the gate. Fortunately; we completed an uneventful flight with no further disruptions by this passenger. In the future I think we should be more explicit with the gate agent when a passenger should be denied boarding; even if it's assumed or implied that said passenger has left.",,,,"ERJ First Officer reported receiving multiple EICAS messages prior to departure that resulted in a return to the gate; a maintenance action; and a passenger becoming unruly.",

I was waiting to go to my seat when a male passenger pushed me against the wall and squeezed himself through the narrow wall. Both the stewardess and I asked him to wait till I could move back or forward to allow him to fit through the narrow walkway. I was stuck in the narrow walkway; [passenger] finally squeezed through and my body was being pinned and we almost could not get unstuck. He was very belligerent to me and the stewardess.[Flight Attendant Statement]During boarding [passenger] pinned a woman between the narrow boarding area and she screamed out in pain. [Passenger] showed me his boarding pass and red passport saying he forgot a bag in the boarding area and then he rushed off the aircraft. I was concerned about the lady that got pinned. She said she would be okay and then continued on to her seat.I did not see the man reboard the aircraft as I meant to speak with him regarding hurting the other [passenger]. I saw him just prior to door closure and politely informed him he hurt a woman. He had total disregard for me and barely looked up from his phone. I spoke with the woman and let her know I had a chat with him.During taxi out my flying partner told me the same [passenger] hit a woman with luggage and did not apologize nor show any concern for her safety.My flying partner was walking through economy completing safety checks and informed me [passenger] was leaning across the aisle and refused to move back into his seat area.Three strikes of total disregard for others and crew. Collectively we went back to the gate to remove [passenger]. We did not open the aircraft door until the police arrived. Captain advised to back off the [passenger] in case he became violent when the police spoke with [passenger]. If it became violent then we would deplane the entire aircraft in regards to everyone's safety and security. Captain made an announcement requesting all [passengers] to remain seated since we had a cabin issue.The door to the aircraft was opened when the police arrived. [Passenger] voluntarily came to the open aircraft door. Operations Manager spoke with [passenger] informing him was being removed from the flight. He could leave himself or gather his family and leave. He chose to gather his belongings and family and deplaned. I was standing next to the [passenger] when the police and Operations Manager were talking to him. I was concerned he may elbow me in the face. I was blocked from moving away from the man until he went back in the cabin.We departed and I did quite a bit of damage control with the passengers in Economy. [Flight Attendant] was able to complete most of the First Class service alone as I picked up for coach. We had to sit for several minutes twice because of turbulence. I was working damage control and trying to reassure the remaining [passengers] that everyone was safe and connections should be okay. I was back and forth between First Class and Economy making sure passengers didn't have to sit for too long with trash and worry.In ZZZ approximately 20-30 passengers deplaning thanked us for keeping the flight safe and secure. Without a doubt I am sure [passenger] may have misbehaved more than what the crew observed. [Flight Attendant] mentioned the children traveling with [passenger] cringed in fear when interacting with [passenger].[Passenger] essentially was thrashing about with luggage. He was being aggressive and intimidating other passengers around him hitting others. He was pushing other passengers out of his way. He had total disregard for physically hurting others and blocking crew members from completing required safety checks.On arrival in ZZZ; Supervisor met the flight to debrief with the entire crew after all passengers were off. [Flight Attendant] and myself were removed from our pairings to recover and cope with the ordeal. All Flight Attendants and [Supervisor] found a quiet gate area to talk about the event. I requested EAP (Employee Assistance Program] intervention. [Supervisor]; [Flight Attendant] and I went to the ZZZ domicile to wait for hotel assignments. [Supervisor] provided [Flight Attendant] and I with [Company] EAP and provided us with snacks; fluids and kindness/care.

Specifically; the subject customer presented the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and his behavior was disrupting the quiet enjoyment of the flight for surrounding customers. As he boarded the aircraft at the end of the boarding process with an unidentified Customer Service Representative (CSR); the subject customer; who was ticketed for seat XXD; kept asking if each sequential seat aft of row 7 was his assigned seat. For unknown reasons; the CSR eventually reseated the subject customer in seat XXC; rather than his originally ticketed seat of XXD. A short time later; Flight Attendant seated in close proximity to the subject customer (seat XXA) reported to Purser that she detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on the subject customer's breath; she observed the subject customer talking to himself and making unintelligible statements. Flight Attendant stated she was very uncomfortable with his behavior. The subject customer also expressed concern regarding overhead stowage of his carry-on luggage. Purser accommodated the subject customer's request by facilitating the stowage of his carry-on luggage in the overhead bin located above seat XB; which; based on the aircraft row numbering convention; was three rows forward of the subject customer's seat. After his carry-on luggage was stowed; the subject customer got up from his seat; walked forward to the overhead bin where his carry-on luggage was stowed; opened the bin and removed and opened his carry-on luggage; apparently to locate and remove one or more personal items. A female customer seated at XB; later approached Purser and complained the subject customer was loud and verbally and physically disruptive as he was handling his luggage. The female customer asked that the subject customer's carry-on luggage be relocated away from her seat location. Additionally; the female customer seated in XB and another customer seated in the vicinity of row X reported the subject customer was presenting difficulty walking. Specifically; he was stumbling as he walked back to his seat; and as he approached his seat; he abruptly bumped into seat XC; which was occupied by another customer. The customer seated in XC approached Purser and complained about the disruption of the customer's quiet enjoyment of the flight resulting from the subject customer. Purser stated she also directly observed the subject customer's stumbling return to his seat.In addition to her direct observations and the reports from the aforementioned customers; Purser also stated; based the subject customer's apparent intoxication and disruptive behavior; she was concerned for her personal safety in the cabin once under way.Based on Purser statement; I had developed the following concerns:1) Based on the subject customer's observed and reported behavior; he presented a high likelihood of further disrupting the travel experience of our other customers; which was planned for a block time of XA:00.2) I was very concerned about Purser's personal safety as it related to the subject customer. Specifically; if Purser perceived her personal safety was at risk; this was an unacceptable work environment for her; and; consequently; her ability to perform her required duties could be impaired.3) Based on the report of the subject customer's instability and stumbling as he returned to his seat; I was concerned his lack of coordination and inability to follow simple instructions presented an unreasonable risk to his safety; the safety of our other customers and the safety of our Flight Attendants; should an incident requiring evacuation occur.Based on my concerns I called ZZZ [Company] Airport Operations and requested a Customer Service Supervisor respond to our gate for an intoxicated customer. At approximately XB:00 HRS UTC; Customer Service Agent responded to our aircraft. Atthis point; having contacted Operations and requested a Customer Service Supervisor for my stated concern of a suspected intoxicated customer; I was under the impression CSA was the Customer Supervisor I had requested; when; in fact he was not a Supervisor. I explained the situation and my concerns to CSA. In response; CSA asked if I would consider reseating the subject customer to another location in the cabin. I reviewed my concerns with CSA; particularly my concern for safety should a non-normal situation occur during the flight; and requested he remove the subject customer from the aircraft. CSA acknowledged my concerns and stated he would remove the subject customer from the flight.The subject customer was removed. However; several minutes after his removal Customer Service Supervisor responded to [gate]; entered the flight deck and began questioning my decision to have the subject customer removed. Specifically; Supervisor stated she had interviewed the subject customer in the jet bridge and; based on her experience; she found him to be 'not that drunk' in comparison to other customers who had been boarded on flights in the past. Supervisor continued by stating the subject customer's plans included attending a festival in ZZZ1 and that she would have to rebook him on a flight the following day if he was denied boarding. Supervisor acknowledged it was my 'boat;' but asked if I would reconsider. I reviewed my three chief concerns cited above with her and addressed her assertion that; based on her interview of the subject customer in the jet bridge; he was not 'that drunk.' Specifically; I stated; based on my previous training and experience as a police officer; intoxicated individuals frequently improve their comportment when they perceive meaningful consequences associated with their intoxicated condition. However; such an improvement is not an indication the intoxicated individual is any less intoxicated. In concluding our exchange; I informed Supervisor I would be unable to reconsider my decision.In addition to the safety concerns cited above; I continue to be concerned about the nature of my interaction with Supervisor. FAR 121.575 (c) prohibits boarding any passenger who is or appears to be inebriated/intoxicated. If the intoxicated passenger has already boarded; he must be removed.FOM states:'In accordance with the FARs; the Captain shall refuse to carry any person who appears to be intoxicated and/or under the influence of drugs (medical conditions are exempt). Good conduct and/or a calm demeanor does not factor into the decision for the intoxicated passenger to remain on a flight.'In asserting her position to me; Supervisor did not seem to consider the information provided by Purser; as reported to her by numerous other customers and the aforementioned Flight Attendant; as well as Purser direct observations of the subject customer's indication of alcohol intoxication and associated conduct and comportment prior to her arrival at [gate]. Supervisor concern seemed to be solely focused on the subject customer's satisfaction; rather than the safety of the flight and the travel experience of all our other customers on board.FOM Security Alcohol and Smoking PoliciesALCOHOLPROHIBITED SERVICEAlcoholic beverage service is governed by FAR 121.575 which states that no person may drink an alcoholic beverage onboard an aircraft unless it was served by the Air Carrier. Additionally; the regulation prohibits the airline from serving alcohol to anyone who:* Appears to be inebriated/intoxicated* Is a prisoner* Is escorting a prisoner* Is armedDURING BOARDINGFAR 121.575 (c) prohibits boarding any passenger who is or appears to be inebriated or intoxicated. If the intoxicated passenger has already boarded; he must be removed. Refer to Passenger Removal Policy in this chapter.RECOGNITION OF INTOXICATIONPilots are not trained to recognize levels of intoxication. The responsibility for recognizing such a condition rests jointly between Customer Service personnel and the Purser. A customer who displays signs of intoxication after boarding; during taxi; flight; or is found drinking from non-carrier served alcoholic supply shall be reported to the Captain by the Purser. If prior to cabin door closure; the Captain will coordinate with the Customer Service personnel and Purser for passenger removal. See Passenger Removal Policy in this chapter. When dealing with passengers who appear intoxicated; tact and discretion are essential. Do not discuss the customer's behavior in the presence of other customers. Refer to Security Threat Levels in this chapter.FOM Security Passenger RemovalPASSENGER (CUSTOMER) REMOVALThe Captain has the authority to request removal of any passenger in the interest of safety. The removal of a passenger must be based on a thorough assessment of the passenger's behavior and not on attributes such as physical appearance; race; gender; religion; gender identity; or ethnicity. If considering the removal of a passenger; the Captain shall:*Huddle with team members to thoroughly assess and consider all viewpoints.*Discuss and evaluate resolutions with the Purser; Customer Service Agent; Customer Resolution Officer (CRO) and Ground Security Coordinator (GSC).*If; after a thorough assessment; the decision is made to remove the passenger; then the removal is accomplished by Customer Service. Customer Service employs a variety of removal protocols; dependent on the situation. Reference the Threat Level 1 checklist for any applicable guidance. Submit an IOR. Reference the Communications chapter; Required Reports.PASSENGER INTOXICATION In accordance with the FARs; the Captain shall refuse to carry any person who appears to be intoxicated and/or under the influence of drugs (medical conditions are exempt).

Before we pushed from the gate; the FM (Flight Manager) came into the cockpit and told us that the passenger seated in XX was already giving her trouble. The passenger refused to sit in his assigned seat and demanded to sit in an aisle seat. The passenger was moved to XA. He also would not get off his phone and was not listening to directions from the Flight Attendants. After we took off; the FM called us and advised that the passenger got up to use the lavatory while the seatbelt sign was still on. The FM had told the passenger that the Flight Attendants were instructed to remain seated for turbulence; but the passenger unlocked the lavatory door and used it against direction from the flight crew. During flight; the passenger became irate and belligerent. He began yelling at the Flight Attendants and passengers; using racial slurs; verbal obscenities; and was berating the two Flight Attendants working the main cabin. The FM confronted the individual and the passenger advised her that he was drunk and apologized. Then; as she walked away; he called her an obscene name. This information was then forwarded to us in the flight deck; along with the additional information that the passenger was banging on the bulkhead; punching his seat; yelling; and demanding free food and drinks. I pulled out the FOM to look up threat levels and concluded that we were at a Threat Level 1. My Captain then said to me; 'Sounds like we have a Threat Level 1.' And I said I was just looking it up and that I completely agreed. The Captain then stated; 'If we declare a threat level; then we have to do a report' and then he did not do anything. No threat level was declared.As the flight continued; we were informed that the passenger continued to be belligerent until he fell asleep in his seat. The FM also told me that a passenger had said that they saw the passenger in question drink four drinks in quick succession in the bar before the flight. We were also told that a passenger stated that they overheard the drunk passenger state on his phone; 'If anyone gives me trouble on the flight; I have knives.' I did not hear the entirety of the Captain's reply to the FM because I had received a radio call; but his response sounded very dismissive and not supportive at all towards the FM and her concern. After the call; the Captain said 'I don't care if he has ties or not.' I corrected the Captain and said; 'No; she said he has KNIVES;' trying to convey the idea that this passenger is a threat. He didn't make any reply and continued to read on his iPad. I looked again in the FOM and read that a 'threat to use a concealed weapon and/or prohibited item to cause death or serious bodily harm' was a Threat Level 3. While I personally didn't think the threat was entirely credible; since it came from another passenger and he would've had to get the 'knives' past TSA (Transportation Security Administration); I still had the FM's statement in the back of my head. During a bathroom break; I asked the FM if she wanted law enforcement to meet us at the gate. After she replied that she wasn't sure; I told her not to hesitate to ask us and I would back her up in her request.Before we started our descent to Denver; I asked the Captain if he wanted me to call ahead to get law enforcement to meet us at the aircraft; trying to advocate as a First Officer that something needed to happen. The Captain replied no.The flight continued and we landed in Denver and pulled into the gate. The Captain quickly gathered his suitcase and his flight bag; and left the aircraft to go catch our next flight. This left me; the First Officer; to handle the situation with the Flight Attendants. At this point; everyone was off the airplane except the one passenger who was still sleeping. I told the Flight Attendants not to wake him up and let him continue to sleep while we came up with aplan.I went up to the gate area and asked the gate agent to get a Supervisor. After a few minutes and no Supervisor showing up; I went to go find one myself at the adjacent gate. I told her that we had a drunk passenger who refused to get off the aircraft. As the two of us walked down the jet bridge; we could hear him screaming at the Flight Attendants demanding Aspirin. The Supervisor tried to talk to the passenger; but he was very combative and refused to listen to her; hurling curse words and verbal obscenities at her. After a few minutes; the fire department and paramedics arrived; followed shortly by police. After some time; the fire department was able to coax him onto an aisle chair so he could get off the airplane. As the passenger moved close to me in the aisle chair; I could smell the alcohol around him. He was brought up into the terminal where he continued to scream at the police officers; demanding to talk to his attorney. The passenger was placed in handcuffs and taken downstairs to detox.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported dealing with an intoxicated and abusive passenger during flight.",

It became apparent that while we thought he was sleeping with the blanket covering his head he had indeed been puffing his cigarette. (A-FA) then realized when she thought she had smelled a faint cigarette odor in FC (First Class) but found no smoke or anything in the lav she chalked it up to being on someone's clothes. These types of cigarettes are a newer items that are smokeless and quite odorless as well. He was standing outside baggage claim as we were walking to our crew van so (C-FA) and myself politely went up to him and mentioned that we had found his smokeless cigarettes around his seat. Our intention was to politely tell him that it was a fine-able offense and so for future flying he'd have been warned. However before we finished speaking he started berating us and our airline; using explicit language and saying we are the worst airline he's ever experienced and that the cigarettes had fallen out of his pocket. He said that he had already tweeted a negative review and was awaiting [TV New Channel] response and to get the '[Expletive deleted]' which (C-FA) and I remained calm and polite and walked away knowing anything else we might say would fall on deaf ears. During our agricultural form pass-out of the flight we had limited quantities so I allowed a few traveling families to include their elderly grandparents on their forms so that we had enough. (Literally we were short only 2 forms on walk through). [Passenger] said he heard that and was notifying [State] Agriculture that we allowed them to lie on their forms. However we had a few families take extra forms and then delivered those to previously stated families to fill out for the grandparents so his allegations were obviously not true. He was a very rude passenger and escalated any event on this flight to create a very hostile work environment. Earlier submitted report:We had a very disgruntled first time [Airline] flyer occupying seat XX.His first grievance was that we could not serve him a double bourbon upon boarding and then became pissed when he realized we served our pre-departure beverages in plastic glasses and refused his sparkling white wine when it was handed to him. His companion then requested a pillow which I told them we did not have and his response was 'Do you guys have [expletive deleted] anything'; I apologized and walked away. During the flight while I was guarding for a Pilot break he tried to stand and come forward; I politely explained I needed everyone to remain seated as the pilots were utilizing the lav. He began to complain once seated again that this was '[expletive deleted] unnecessary and he's never seen it before'...he then got impatient and got up to attempt going to the aft and rudely made his way past our C doing a water service cussing under his breath. While there was no personal damage done; his choice of foul language and bad attitude is worth mentioning seeing as our normally favored [Airline] service was not enjoyed by him and he may write one healthy complaint.[Passenger] should not be allowed to fly our airline and should be fined for his obvious rule breaking behavior.

We boarded once; had a fume event; deplaned and boarded again. I conducted my exit row briefing as all passengers were already seated in the exit rows. I went to the front to tell the #1; exit rows briefed.  While standing near the boarding door; a woman boarded and said to us; 'the three guys behind me are drunk.'   Behind her were three tall men; one was very big; who were loud and rambunctious.  I said the #1 and #3 that they should not be allowed to board. They dismissed my comment and said they would talk to them.  I entered the cockpit and calmly said to the Captain; 'three drunk passengers just boarded and it is policy per our manual to not allow drunk passengers to board; but I will respect your decision whatever you decide to do.'  At this point the passenger who sat in XXC (my tablet showed that as an empty seat) was loudly going through all the overhead bins looking for a missing bag.  He finally found it. Prior to that he had trouble finding his seat and had to go back up to row 14 from about row 25.  I did smell alcohol on XXC passenger. (I have; unfortunately; a very good sense of smell.) The #3 apparently spoke to him (I did not see that) and the #3 and #1 said the passengers in XXA; XXB and XXC were fine to fly. The agent and CRO (Complaint Resolution Officer) came on and told the Captain they were OK to fly.  Based on the information from the #1; #3; agent and CRO the Captain made the decision to let them remain on board. While taxiing out; we stopped and sat for about 20 minutes or longer; due to weights and balances that needed to be done by hand (as explained by the Captain via a PA). When we started to go again we were close to take off and there was yelling and screaming; and the call light being pushed at around row 14.  The #1 started walking back.  I was concerned the #1 would be in the aisle during take-off so I made an announcement that if it was an emergency to ring the call light again; otherwise the flight attendants had to remain seated as we are about to take off.  I then called the Captain.  He said he heard my announcement and stopped. The #2 went up to the passenger and spoke with him.  The #1 went back up to the front.  The #2 said that XXC said we 'were delaying the flight to make more money and that he pays our _____ salary.'  (You will have to check with the #2 about details of that conversation.)  The #2 came to the back; called the captain and said we could go. When ready to start the service; the #2 said he is not comfortable serving any alcohol on this flight with these rowdy passengers.  I said ok; you are the galley; I am fine with that.  When pushing the cart up I told the #3 that the #2 did not want to serve alcohol.  At about row 3 the #3 asked me to go to the back to get a vodka.  I said the #2 isn't comfortable serving alcohol.  He made a comment I didn't hear.  I then said if you want one vodka; then get it from first.  He went to first and got it.  He then proceeded to get several other drinks for a few rows from first.  This put me in an awkward middle situation between the #2 and #3. When we got to row XX; I worked the cart so the #3 could deal with XXA; B; C.  Of course they requested alcoholic drinks. I did not hear what the #3 said; but he did not give him alcohol that I could see. Then my passengers were asking for drinks also.  If the #3 had complied with the request of the #2 not to serve; I wouldn't have; but because the #3 was serving; I did.  I went to the #2 and requested wine; vodka.  He said we aren't doing drinks.  I said but the #3 started serving so we kind of have to.  He said what about the last three rows that I told we aren't serving.  I said; I don't know. Just before landing I called the Captain and said I wanted to update him on what has occurred so he wouldn't be blindsided with anything later on.  He said we would discuss once on the ground. When we got to ZZZ; the Captain wanted tohave a debrief. During the debrief (there was also a fume event on this flight); the Captain said he allowed the passenger to board because the #1; #3; agent and CRO said the passenger was good to fly.  When he finished I said; 'Captain; the #2 and I have 22 years of flying each.  The #1 and #3 are new hires.  In this case; experience trumps opinion and while their opinion was that these passengers could fly; experience tells us that if there is a problem on the ground; it is much worse in the air. The #1 and #3 then got mad and said some remarks (frankly at this point I stopped listening to them.  I had had it.)  I added; 'it is in our manual as part of flight attendant procedures not to board drunk passengers.' He said that he made the decision based on what the #1; #3; agent and CRO said.  I said I understood that and then added; 'the agents just want to get rid of the passengers and have a history of boarding them when they shouldn't so they don't have to deal with them.' The #1 rolled her eyes and said I complained about everything. She abruptly stood up and said she was leaving and didn't need to hear anymore of this. The managers and Captain finished the meeting and everyone left.  Suggestions: For new hires to follow procedure and not allow drunk passengers to board.  Also for them not to mislead the Captain on how drunk they were. Other station operation issues: Agents boarded drunk passengers and when asked they just responded that it is OK.'; 'Agents boarded drunk passengers and when asked they just responded that it is OK. Other individual factors: #1 and #3 advised Captain to allow drunk passengers to board when I informed the Captain and the flight attendants that this was against policy.",,,,"B737-800 Flight Attendant reported a fume event resulting in Maintenance delay prior to departure.

I was briefed that upon further investigation it appeared that some 38 circuit breakers had tripped and upon consultation with [Maintenance Control] and Dispatch the decision to divert due to a possible issue with PECS system was made. I concurred with this decision. Also during this time there apparently was an issue with an uncooperative passenger leading to declaring a threat level 1 and law enforcement was requested to meet the aircraft upon arrival. We continued to ZZZZ and landed uneventfully. The entire crew coordination during this event was excellent.",,"First Officer and myself completed first rest break subsequently receiving a transition briefing on the flight deck from Captain . Our position on the route was in the area of transition to ETOPS entry and Oceanic crossing. With my taking Captain seat on the flight deck and he going on rest break; I reviewed the cockpit discovering a status message: ELEC P300 DISTR CHANNEL and ELEC P100 PANEL. Part of Captain's briefing included an INOP primary L FWD and R SIDE window heat. Curious if the status message was associated with the failure or written up separately in the electronic logbook; I reviewed the electronic log items unable to determine any association or an independent item. Further; First Officer had pulled up the electronic circuit breaker status page to note multiple pages of system discrepancies listed with circuit breaker position 'Unknown'. Unable to research the status message satisfactorily; I called Captain to inquire his knowledge of the situation. He was not familiar with the matter and chose to come up to the cockpit for review; whereby he decided to resume his seat to make a satcom call to [Maintenance Control] with his headset. First Officer and myself continued normal flight duties while listening and commenting as the conversation with [Maintenance Control] continued. The concern from the flight deck were the many critical system circuit breakers in position 'Unknown'; thus possibly affecting normal and/or back up system capabilities. Maintenance Control researched and indicated that the status was dispatchable and deferable for ETOPS. However; with specific review of individual systems queried by Captain; he was not able to ascertain the status of several individual critical systems to include systems like landing gear relays and others. Upon further review; one critical system in particular; the POWER ELECTRONICS COOLING SYSTEM (PECS); the liquid cooling system for the large motor power distribution system in the aft E/E compartment appeared and was stated by [Maintenance Control] to have a pump that was not operable. This was a standout item of concern; among several; to the 3 pilots; [Maintenance Control]; and Dispatch. For me personally having been involved as a ferry crew with [Company's] first PECS replacement involving [Manufacturer] and other lead engineers support; it is a very critical system needing to function properly. I also recalled how some of the MEL script at the time was inaccurate; unsafe; and subscript of how we were ok to continue; dispatch and defer on the ground questionable. With the [oceanic] crossing ahead of us and the status of many of our systems 'Unknown'; the Captain; with multiple sources of input; ultimately made the decision to divert to ZZZZ to address the issue on the ground. The flying First Officer arrived in the cockpit from rest break during the divert and subsequently landed the aircraft. Much of the electrical fault issue was resolved by ZZZZ Maintenance who were familiar and had dealt with the issue on 3 separate occasions. They were successful in resetting much of the faulted channels with the exception of the landing gear specifics. Meanwhile; our pilot crew duty timed out whereby Maintenance continued working to repair. As a side note; luckily with a few hours of work; the repair was complete and a [Company] cargo crew in the EMPTY terminal happened to be available to continue the flight to ZZZ with Status Normal.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported multiple electrical failures during cruise that resulted in a diversion.",

The passenger next to me; also no mask; slept most of the flight; but other passengers in First Class (I was assigned [first class seat]) did notice the FA behavior. Given the sensitive situation; I simply pointed at my own mask and nodded. The two attendants up front then seemed to keep the masks on.

Wanting to resolve the problem; I waited for the C/S agent (different guy; and this one had a mask and gloves on) to arrive and I followed him back. The man had a mask on his face. He told the gate agent that company was not complying with promises made on their booking. 'I booked this seat and it showed no occupant here;' he pointed at well-masked young man in [the seat]. 'I can't have this man in this seat.' The C/S agent explained that the booking said 'If available' and that we had to accommodate additional passengers.' C/S agent said; 'You are welcome to de-plane and I'll book you on another flight.' He said; 'I'm staying; I have a connection in ZZZ.' The C/S agent looked at me; and I said to the man; 'Well; we have the issue of how you treated my Purser.' He mentioned being scared; and that he'd not do that again. I said; 'Okay; I'll want to hear what you say to her; as I'm leaving that decision up to her.' I also offered him use of an N-95; if I could find one. He said pointing to his mask; 'This covers better than the N-95; so no thanks; I don't need that.' He apologized to the FA Purser and ensured he be calm going forward. The Purser could have said; 'Okay; thank you;' but of course; she didn't. She said loudly that; (paraphrase) 'What you did is unacceptable; and if you repeat that behavior in any way; there will be security to meet you at the gate.' The passenger nodded and said simply; (paraphrase) 'I'm scared; I wasn't supposed to have a person next to me.'

I went over the governmental support; etc. He calmed down enough that I felt we'd be okay; but also told him this was my first flight in [XX]-days and that we'd both need to be on our A-game; as there were likely to be errors resulting from these many threats.

We started both engines as me and the Captain talked about because of the short taxi. Then we did the taxi check before we moved the aircraft due to the short taxi. We then taxied towards Runway XXR and during that time we did the before takeoff checklist. I'm pretty sure I called the back and told the flight attendants and cabin we were next for takeoff. After going through the checklist and noticed that the flight attendants did not call us. So I called back there to see if they were ready and from what I heard they were. It was not as clear as normal because of the wearing of the mask for COVID. We then closed the before takeoff checklist before departure and was cleared to takeoff. We then arrived at ZZZ1 with no issues.

Evidently this passenger had been flagged for noncompliance with the mask policy on a previous flight. The Supervisor came and told me that she had counseled the passenger and boarded her.

She complied and slept most of the way to ZZZ1. We did depart one minute late; and the delay message referenced our needing to deal with this passenger. Two other people were also non compliant. A couple boarded with masks pulled down and while carrying coffee cups. The man asserted that he knew airline policy and if he was drinking; he was exempt from mask usage. The Flight Attendant told him that it's only for active drinking; not just holding the cup. Initially; he was dismissive of her instructions; but eventually he and his companion did put their masks up. By the end of the flight; he and the Flight Attendant had a respectful discussion about the policy.The Supervisor knew the first passenger had caused trouble yet boarded her anyway. Certainly the agent saw the other couple board while not complying with the mask policy.  I feel there still isn't enough specific guidance on mask usage.The airline needs to be very specific with passenger expectations regarding mask usage. It's a hot button issue and it creates division among the other (compliant) passengers which could lead to an inflight altercation and diversion. The mask policy is also creating a lot of chances for passengers' noncompliance with crew member instructions. People look for loopholes. The airline needs to be very blunt and specific; vs leaving it to the cabin crew to play the role of babysitter.

The passenger got verbally abusive and made physical threats peppered with loud obscene language. Our FAs did not feel safe and specifically because of the physical threats. Over the years I have learned to trust our FAs when it comes to passenger relations. Every time they've flagged a passenger as a potential problem they are almost always correct and the passenger becomes a worse problem airborne. Flying during the COVID pandemic has been stressful; and I believe that may have been a factor. Interacting with masked people is a barrier to clear communication and misunderstandings can easily flare up into confrontations. That being said; our co-workers deserve to be treated with respect and verbal/physical threats will not be tolerated.We have a lot more new customers flying these days due to the decreased fare prices. Customers who have never flown before are unfamiliar with societal rules we crew members take for granted. This can lead to misunderstandings and inappropriate confrontations. Perhaps a simple video guide for new customers to watch before boarding would address passenger expectations?

The two passengers were able to exit the aircraft before the other passengers could notify me. I assured them the plane was terminated and would be sanitized for the evening and we agreed that the only thing remaining we could do about it was to notify Operations and request they inform the cleaners of the location to take extra precautions to protect themselves and to sanitize that area thoroughly.

It was a clearly visible amount but didn't indicate heavy bleeding.By the time [deplaning] was complete and I could go to row XX; most of the moisture from the saliva and nasal secretions had dried and was barely visible; only the blood stood out.

It would have dried completely had we taken the time to tidy the aircraft first. In our PA about passenger compliance we emphasize seat belts and smoking and perhaps that is outdated and detracts from where the emphasis currently should lie.

When I asked Inflight (dual CSR) Supervisor [to] inquire about adding more FAs for our very full flight (with at least one being a [foreign language] speaker); he said that XX was the 'new staffing'. When I had time to check my staffing sheet again; I saw that [the supervisor] was incorrect. We should've had XY FA's working with this load instead of XX. All FAs were extremely busy and task saturated. Only Y economy FAs scheduled. One FA must do required galley supply/security check (which encompasses 2 actual galleys--the Aft most at Location X and the auxiliary one at Location Y) and has little to no time to actually monitor in cabin. One is required for greeting at door X. That leaves only X FAs to monitor the space from row XX to XY; which on this flight was close to XXX passengers. FAs must assist with any questions passengers have (which are plentiful) assist with stowing baggage--direct them to stow baggage in compliance with FARs; assist with seating issues; and give special briefings  and fulfill other requests. X FAs in an extremely busy economy cabin is woefully understaffed. To compound matters; [the company] has; in their infinite wisdom; repeatedly failed to assign [foreign language] speakers to this ZZZ-ZZZZ1 flight. As a result; all FAs had an extremely hard time assisting passengers with their questions and directing them to stow baggage according to FARs before door closure.(amongst other things--like informing them of landing formalities/required forms)There were multiple seating issues including too many lap children in a row for amount of O2 masks; customers requesting seat changes; customers unhappy with seat assignments; and multiple requests for FAs to [assist] customers--in other words; a normal full flight to Country X; however understaffed and without benefit of a [foreign language] speaker.Everyone...was extremely busy; had multiple seat change requests; and had our usual duties of hanging coats; fulfilling drink requests (even without formal preflight beverage service; customers want drinks before leaving and we are required to give them upon request); meal order taking and also assisting/directing baggage stowage and any other requests/problems; also without benefit of a [foreign language] speaker.As Purser I have to brief with the pilots (who most days including this one do not board aircraft until after passenger boarding begins); greet at door X until closure (since no FA # XX was scheduled); hand out hand wipes while greeting; interact with customers; make boarding announcements; answer questions and liaise with cockpit/customer service for any post boarding mechanical; seating or customer issues; of which there were many. Pursers are also to take meal orders on the X zone; which is almost impossible to complete before door closure as the company wants us to do for a timely inflight service. I couldn't even get halfway finished as I had to continually ask a passenger with a bit of English to translate my requests to the [foreign language] only speaking customers. Inflight/CS supervisor did assist with a few seating issues when I informed [the supervisor] of them; including in economy and a very angry customer who wouldn't sit down or stow his bags in protest that he didn't get the bulkhead seat that he had requested. Economy seating issues were fixed; however [another] customer did not like the answers given to him by supervisor and continued to stand near his assigned (and unwanted) seat and refused to stow his bags. Close to main door closure time; Captain informed me that we had maintenance issues and that we wouldn't be closing on time; so I could continue to attempt taking meal orders without menus (which would've had a translation) and without benefit of speaking the language of the customers. Supervisor was visibly agitated at the delay and reminded me to do a final boarding announcement to try and get passengersto stow bags and sit down. There were probably XX people still trying to find places for their bags in economy and two FAs went back to assist. No CSR did a final boarding announcement; as they usually do; and left it to me. I made the announcement; but saw that there were still probably XX-XY people still standing in economy and multiple bins open as far as I could see. All FAs not actively engaged in duties went to assist; but it was extremely difficult for them to get people to stow things and sit down. Again; we had no scheduled [foreign language] speaker and the customers (as usual with passengers who don't fly much) kept trying to leave bags at bulkheads or completely blocking aisles which we could not; for obvious reasons; allow. I left boarding FA at door and went back to my other duty of attempting to take meal orders; then noticed that the door had been shut without my knowledge. There were still at least XX people standing and multiple bins open. [A] customer who didn't like his seat assignment was also still defiantly standing with bags in the aisle to protest his condition. Everyone had multiple large bags and it had been difficult finding space for them all. Compounding this was the new policy of boarding pillows/blankets in large bags in OH bins; which takes away at least 4 large bins. To mitigate this; the Economy FAs; in addition to all their other duties; were forced to hand out the pillows/blankets during boarding; instead of after takeoff as we are told to by the company. That bin space was necessary; but handing out pillows/blankets was yet another task that the 2 FAs had to undertake by themselves in a crowded and busy boarding process.I knocked on door window and motioned CSR to open; which she did. Supervisor reappeared and I showed the situation/explained that it is an FAR that we cannot close door with passengers standing and bins open. Especially considering the load and the fact that OH bin space was very tight. [The Supervisor] was again visibly agitated and yelled at me that 'I told you to make a final boarding announcement to get them to sit down'. I calmly told [the Supervisor] that yes; I did make that final boarding announcement; however the majority of the passengers most likely did not understand it. I made another announcement; but it still took a few minutes for passengers to comply and FAs to close all bins. [The Supervisor] closed the door with a customer still standing and refusing to stow bags. I protested but [the Supervisor] closed [it] again; anyway.",,,,"Purser reported multiple issues and difficulties during the boarding process and cited not having enough flight attendants to properly staff the flight as a contributing factor.",

I conveyed what had happed to both FA A and the CA.  Shortly after 10;000 feet as I was heading forward to retrieve a set of headphones for another guest; as I walk by; I find her laying across XX1 and 2 with her head propped up on her book bag on the aisle arm rest; head hanging over into the aisle without a mask.  I tried rousing her quietly with no response from her and then gently tapped her on the shoulder and her exclaiming; 'What?!  What do you want?'  I politely asked her to please put her mask on and cover both her nose and mouth as required and to please ensure her seatbelt remained fastened while the seatbelt sign was on as we were still ascending.  She begrudgingly complied as she continued to complain and others around her asked her to wear it as well.  During service; once again; Passenger X had her mask below her chin as she sat with her foot propped up in the seat and was painting her toenails.  I politely asked her again to comply with the mask requirement and to please not polish her toenails as the fumes were offensive to those around her.  She denied painting her toenails (with polish in an opened [bottle and] nail polish remover pad in hand). I explained to her once again that wearing a mask is a requirement that she had been made aware of prior to boarding and that it wasn't fair to the other passengers and crew on board as everyone else was diligent in complying. I also made her aware that she had been informed several times.  As I started to walk forward to let FA A know what had transpired.  We called the CA and let him know that we were doing and to be prepared in the event that the situation escalated.  The guest in front of her Passenger Y asked if there was something more I could do or move her when suddenly her voice level became elevated and she said 'There!  I pulled the mask up and I have a headache so go away!' Subsequently we (FA A and myself) asked the Passenger Y if he would be more comfortable in another seat and he accepted.  Passenger Y and several other guests commended us for how we handled the situation.  Passenger Y gave his permission for this airline to contact him regarding the situation and events. Passenger X complied for the rest of the flight.  Upon final compliance before landing; Passenger X was asked by both FA A and myself to again stow her bags which she finally did by tossing and kicking them under the seat.  Upon landing she quickly stood; gathered her belongings and hurried off of the plane before rows in front of her stood.

She moved back. I went back to my FWD jumpseat and called the Captain to tell him we were secure and passenger was back in her seat.

As he walked up during our service in flight he said he thought he noticed a beer bottle on her seat tray. I asked him if he wanted me to check and he said yes. I walked back and there was an open beer bottle can on her tray. I asked her what was in the bottle and asked if it was an X brand beer and alcohol. She said yes and I told her she could not have her alcohol on board.  She asked why but said OK; and I took it and showed the aft FA in the galley then threw it away and immediately called the flight deck. The FO apparently answered and I told him the same passenger that had tried to move in to the exit row and we had a mask issue with had an open beer on her tray that we took from. I told him she did not appear drunk as she was answering my questions clearly and cognitively; but had a little smart attitude.  During the rest of the flight I continued to collect trash in the aisle about every 10 minutes to check on her. It seemed she had 2 other friends in the exit row area that she was talking to that she kept looking back at then looked at us to see if we were watching but she didn't seem to be doing anything else wrong until she removed her mask then the aft FA gave her a warning and she kept her mask on after that except for drinking some water the other FA said he thought it was.  After we deplaned another passenger in seat Z4; said as he deplaned - Do you want to talk to me? I said yes the Captain would because at that point I wasn't sure what he meant but he had given me eye contact during the flight like he did not know what to think of the passenger.  Another passenger deplaned who had been sitting in A2 was not happy with the passenger either apparently. Passenger in Z4 told the Captain on the jet bridge that she had been saying swear words and how she was going to write a letter to airline and what she was going to do the other FA and I?

I noticed a passenger not wearing his mask properly. The mask was only covering his mouth. I reminded him to wear his mask so that it covered both his nose and mouth.

When arriving we noticed the customer service having a hefty conversation with what I had assumed was a passenger for Flight ABC. Another agent checked the crew in for boarding; whom mentioned she would be controlling and boarding the flight. She continued by stating she wasn't aware with what the agent at the counter was dealing with; but would find out more. A short time after myself and the additional crew boarded; customer service advised us 'we now have a passenger who cannot wear a mask on our flight due to medical reasons.' We all asked if there was evidence to support her statement. He replied that she did not and also stated he asked for support from his leads whom told him the passenger did not need any.At this time the crew and I asked for inflight supervisors to come to the aircraft. I continued to research the latest inflight documents and COVID-19 requirements. We as a crew were aware that a document stating passengers were required to have proof of exemption to wear a mask. As the aircraft continued to fill up for boarding the A FA and D FA remained in the forward galley speaking to inflight Supervisor.When I approached the forward galley area; Supervisor A asked me how [I was] inward feeling. My response was that 'I don't feel comfortable having a passenger on board the aircraft who states  they can't wear a mask.' Supervisor A stated that I had the opportunity to call crew scheduling to call out of the trip if I didn't feel comfortable. I replied that that wasn't a favorable option. I would then have to call in sick when not sick; affecting my attendance; and then find my own way home from ZZZ.At this time we decided to continue to fly due to not having many options other than to do so. I still wasn't comfortable having interactions with the passenger so the D FA AND myself; B FA; switch positions for the duration of the flight. We re-briefed with the crew and continued the flight.I'm still extremely upset that there was no company or management support for a passenger who claimed to have a medical condition but no proof. Passengers must wear mask or not fly regardless of medical conditions.",,"Upon arrival at the gate; I saw an interaction between the gate agent and a passenger. We presumed that whatever the issue might be that it would be pertinent to our flight. The crew and I then inquired with the agent who then informed the crew that a passenger had notified him that she cannot wear a mask. We asked him if she had a note from a medical professional indicating that she was safe and well enough to fly and was indeed exempt because at this point we had no indicators on our manifest of such an exemption. He said no. We requested a Supervisor and interacted with two; one of which was Supervisor A. The crew told Supervisor A and the other Supervisor that we did not feel safe a number of times; and every time it was dismissed. We were told by both supervisors that asking for a note would violate Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act (HIPPA). From my understanding; one is allowed to ask for documentation for a mask a exemption. HIPPA is not applicable as it only applies to people with access to medical records. Individuals cannot cite that law when refusing to disclose a request for medical exemption as a customer. This was also ignored by supervisors. We searched for supporting facts and our attempts were met with disdain and followed by opinions and lies. Finally; After coming to the realization that management was not going to protect us; I inquired with Supervisor A as to what our recourse was. Supervisor A happily told me that airline has plenty of options in the event that we did not feel safe. The first option would be to call in sick. The second option would be; to put it in her words; 'That's what leaves are for.' To clarify; a Supervisor instructed me to lie to the company and tell them that I am unwell when I am not sick; and left to find my own accommodations or way home in a different state in which I didn't live. Option two in my opinion was inappropriate and irresponsible for Supervisor A to say so casually; as if we did not have families to support or a need for a roof over our heads. I found this comment disheartening and we felt like we had no options left but to work. Supervisor A then continued to tell me that because I was working in the forward cabin that I would have minimal exposure and would be fine; completely disregarding any concern for the well being of the three other crew members in that aircraft. Not only was this disrespectful and unprofessional; but it was also incorrect. Social distancing is almost impossible within crews. We have duties to fulfill including briefing; pilot breaks; cabin service; and emergencies as well as shuttle rides to and from airports that would require a close proximity to one another. I was particularly angered by this reasoning because if a medical or cabin safety issue should arise; management's statement takes the assumption that I would deny my responsibility as the medic; police; and fire personnel on board because of an imaginary line segmenting responsibilities within cabin crew positions. As these conversations were happening I requested Medical and was never patched. I cannot accept this situation because I care about my job; my family; and other people that it could affect by this carelessness.Changes in policies that concretely state protections for FA's; hazard pay; and better alternatives than calling in sick or taking leave.",,"Flight attendants reported a passenger was allowed to fly without wearing a face mask due to a self-reported medical condition.",

Most likely due to the primacy of '12' in our minds the captain set 12;000 feet in the altitude alerter.

The new Controller asked us what altitude we had been given and that is when the mistake was realized. We temporarily leveled at 15;000 feet before ATC cleared us lower.

I retrieved one of the mask policy slips that explains the mask policy and once again approached Passenger X.  I asked her to confirm her last name as I wanted to be certain that it was truly her occupying seat XA.  She confirmed her identity as well as confirmed that she was traveling as a non-revenue passenger.  I gave her the form and explained in great detail that failure to comply with the mask policy would likely result in severe disciplinary action. I explained that the policy is mandatory and that the Captain wanted me to inform her that failure to comply would result in the aircraft being met upon arrival in ZZZ1.  She had requested more alcohol to drink so I informed her that the Captain and I had made the decision to not serve her anymore alcohol since she was being belligerent.  She put her hand up towards my face; shook her head and said 'really? This is so messed up. %$#%#!  (Yes; she used the %$#%# [language] towards me) The mask that she pushed into the aisle was still there so I had another mask with me as I didn't want her to wear a mask that had been in contact with the floor.  I asked her if she would like a clean mask. She accepted my offer of a mask.  I then informed her that I would pass along to the Captain how she responded.The FO exited the cockpit for a break shortly after my conversation with Passenger X.  FO also observed Passenger X sitting in seat XA without wearing her mask.  I once again contacted the cockpit and advised the Captain that Passenger X was still refusing to comply and that FO also witnessed her being non-compliant. Shortly after FO went on her break; I observed Passenger X put her mask on the right of her seat and pull the blanket up over her head.  She kept her head covered until we prepared the cabin for landing.  As we did final safety checks; I observed her remove the blanket from her head.  She was not wearing a mask the entire time she had her head under the blanket.Upon arrival in ZZZ1; the plane was met by two Customer Service Managers as well as In-flight Supervisor.  I explained the situation to all three ladies and I identified Passenger X as she exited the aircraft.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported a passenger was non-compliant with face mask policy.",

More details outlined below of what was said below and suggestions.Flight XX ZZZ-ZZZ1 a very large number of passengers were coming on board not wearing masks (pulled down around neck or not covering nose). I had to stop boarding and address the situation and met with hostility. In their seats I had to address it again. Prior to takeoff I had to have operations come down and address it. The worst offender had an altercation even then. Operations Person X did stand her ground. I had said I want them removed. One of the people traveling said he was the older relative and would take accountability for them. I looked at her we decided to go; it was time to push. It wasn't until she was closing the door that I got the full story of what transpired up top prior to them coming down. It all has to stop.When I checked in for this 3 day...as I walked through ZZZ Airport 2 TSA agents just sitting on a bench no mask! yep! I see police with mask below their noses. These people won't enforce the rules. ZZZ1 is a code red COVID.I cannot fully do my job and protect passengers nor ourselves unless management steps it up; please...asking for help. We carry people with all types of health issues.  The other day Passenger X had to have his COVID test then start his treatments. Only to have a few rows back of them a 2 year old with a non-compliant parent screaming and kicking back of its seat if the mom even held up the mask. Other thing I had this 3 day [were] pilots not even knowing 2 year olds had to wear a mask. Or the no medical conditions preclude wearing a mask. In the last 14 days I actually worked; only 4 cockpit crews wore mask properly.We have great policies in place; however lack of execution has got to change. Passengers notice when our promise isn't fulfilled and employees don't feel safe. Staff have been fabulous about putting out what is expected. Follow-through isn't there from whomever/departments that are tasked to do just that. 1st and [foremost] IF OPS HAS TROUBLE WITH A PAX/PAXS tell us prior to them coming down. If masks are off again...which they usually are then they don't board. That would have made not only this flight but many others go so much better. Passengers appreciate it when they see us enforce policies. The ones I have to address are the ones ALL THROUGH a FLIGHT I have to continually ask to place mask back on. (I'm not talking about just slipping off the nose). Ground (customer service and operations) must monitor gate area and have passengers comply with mask upon entering the area. If a child refuses to place mask on this is when denying boarding must be made. They do not keep them on in the aircraft either. Listen to the parent if they say child won't wear one. They know that child better than we do. Every single one we had trouble with said that. Passengers know when they buy that ticket that their child won't comply and will get away with it. Start fining passengers and employees for non-compliance. It is hard when I work with FAs not agreeing and not enforcing the policy. More don't than do. Please go back to having unannounced check rides. Our passengers are too precious of a commodity to not be protected or have FA's sit and not at least go through the cabin and pick up trash. Some don't get up at all. So much it breaks my heart. Our passengers are everything to me. I love it when I do get a crew. Pilots need to be checked. Personal opinions need to stay out of carrying out policies and procedures especially with this Pandemic. They need to wear a mask if visible in the cockpit during boarding when passengers can see them. WE HAVE DUTIES TOO THAT MAKE WEARING MASKS DIFFICULT. They could be removed briefly while doing a preflight check then put it back on. This is causing a lot of trouble with blow back while trying to enforce mask rule.

During the boarding process from ZZZ-ZZZ1; I noticed that a passenger in the jetway was not wearing a face covering. When she entered the aircraft; at the forward entry; I politely asked the passenger if she had a face covering or a mask and if so; I kindly asked her to put it on. She shook her head and said 'Whatever.' I politely informed her of policy concerning wearing a face covering throughout her journey and offered her a complimentary mask. She appeared to be searching for her personal mask in her purse and refused a complimentary mask and walked away.After the boarding process was totally complete; the Ops Agent confirmed with me that all of the passengers were onboard.I proceeded to make the All Passengers Onboard PA. Afterward; I closed a few forward overhead bins a concerned passenger informed me that when she went to the aft lavatory; the passenger who came onboard without a face covering had taken it off. I thanked the concerned passenger and reminded her that the mask can be briefly removed for eating or taking medicine and also; thanked her for bringing it to my attention.Because; it was bought to my attention. I proceeded to address the passenger who boarded without a face covering and noticed once again that she was not complying and was not wearing a face covering. I politely approached her and kindly asked her to comply with airline policy and to put on her mask. Before; I could say anything else she immediately interrupted me and her tone of voice became aggressive toward me. In her aggressive tone of voice; she said: 'What! You got a problem with me.' I said no ma'am and quietly walked away. Because; she was not wearing a mask and her tone of voice elevated and she became aggressive. I did not want any potential traveling droplets to make contact with my eyes. Therefore; I quietly walked away. At this point; we were still at the gate and I knew I only had a short window to have the non-complaint passenger addressed concerning her not wearing a face covering.Therefore; I went to inform the Captain but he was in the lavatory. Also; I knew the Ops Agent had confirmed with me that boarding was complete. Then; I asked the C-Flight Attendant to stand at the forward entry; so; I could notify the Ops Agent for the appropriate Ground Operations or Supervisor to address the non-complaint passenger then I returned back to the aircraft.When the Ground Operations or Supervisor(s) arrived; I remained in the forward entry while they talked to the non-complaint passenger. I am not sure what she told them or what they said to her; but she and someone traveling with her were escorted off the aircraft. After; they deplaned. The Ops Agent said goodbye and closed the door.   With the world-wide spread of the coronavirus that could potentially spread through respiratory droplets; from person-to-person. In my mind; I was thinking this is a precaution COVID concern for the health and safety of the wellbeing of every passenger and crew member onboard and the best time to address policy is before we pushed back or have to return back to the gate because of a non-compliant passenger who was not wearing a face covering. The Captain was in the lavatory; the boarding process was totally complete and confirmed by the Ops Agent that the last person had boarded the aircraft. I had made the All Passengers Onboard PA. The concerned passenger was watching me after I spoke to the non-complaint passenger to see what I was going to do about the issue. I wanted to be proactive and take precaution; before closing the forward entry door; or possibly having to return back to the gate with a potentially bigger problem. The forward exits were monitored by Flight Attendant C. The aft exits were monitored by Flight Attendant B. When I returned back to the aircraft both Flight Attendants were visible to the passengers.In closing; for the safety; health; and wellbeing ofall of our passengers; the crew; and myself; I am committed to upholding airline policy and value every customer; their concerns; their health; their safety; their wellbeing; their business; and their flight experience when they board our aircraft.I believe it would be helpful if someone from ground operations could be visually within reach; for at least the last ten minutes before departure; to address or assist with any matter that may occur onboard or during the remaining minutes before departure time.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported a passenger was removed due to non-compliance with face mask policy.",

We had a Gate Return incident due to 4 passengers that were disruptive; rude to the FA and would not comply with the ZZZ Airport Mask Policy or the airline Mask Policy. After boarding; the four passengers; seated in seats XX1/2 and XY1/2; intermittently refused to wear their face masks; that is; they would play games and pull their masks off when the FA was away; and then they would put the masks on when the FA would return near them. I was advised of this; and I noted it. I had already made my 'welcome aboard' speech; in person as always; in the main cabin; to the passengers and had thanked everyone for 'complying with the Mask Policy;' so everyone knew the expected 'standard' of behavior and compliance. After we pushed back from gate X; and were halfway to the taxi spot; when I received a call from the FA. She told me the 4 passengers were once again 'playing games' and claiming they did not intend to wear their masks. I made a PA announcement stating that if the passengers did not comply and wear the face masks we would be obligated to return to the gate and deplane the offending passengers. After my PA announcement; the rear FA told me the 4 offending passengers had stated they 'would comply.'We continued to taxi to Runway XXR; but just short of XXR/L; I was called again by the FA indicating the 4 passengers were not wearing their masks and were harassing her and being rude to her; calling her names; and asking why was she [was] bothering them over a simple 'mask issue.' I stopped the plane; had the FO call Ground and OPS in ZZZ to coordinate a Gate Return; and we were given taxi instructions to return to gate X. I also asked the Ground and OPS personnel to call the ZZZ Airport Police and have the Police and a customer service team meet my plane at gate X. After taxiing back to gate X and shutting down the engines and completing the checklists; I asked the passengers to remain in their seats while we waited on the customer service and Police team to arrive. The senior customer service manager asked me and the FAs if the situation could be 'de-escalated or downgraded;' and I told him this was a flight safety issue; and with the show of regulatory non-compliance; plus the verbal harassment and abuse of my aft cabin FA; I did not want those 4 passengers to remain aboard or continue on the flight; as they were probably going to continue their abuse of the FA as well as their non-compliant attitude.I asked for the 4 passengers to be escorted off the flight; and once they were removed from the cabin; the whole remaining passenger load broke into applause for me and the crew. I apologized that we would have a delay on the flight; as we now needed to get fuel and a new release. All this was coordinated with Operations and Ramp Tower. Once we were fueled up and re-released; we proceeded to execute our assigned flight to ZZZ1 without any further incident; and in a safe manner. The FA that had been harassed and verbally abused was visibly shaken by the incident. After arriving at the ZZZ1 airport and shutting down at the gate; the passengers once again broke into applause for our crew; and as I said 'good night' to them at the front of the cabin during the passenger deplanement; many of them once again thanked the crew; and me personally as the Captain; for showing such leadership and desire to protect their health and safety. Unfortunately; our arrival into ZZZ1 had been delayed about 2 hours; due to the return to gate and getting refueled for the second flight; but not one passenger complained about being late; rather they expressed thanks at our concern for their safety.Cause: Because the four passengers seated in seats XX1/2 and XY1/2 did not want to comply with the Mask Policy and refused to wear their face masks properly; in addition to being verbally abusive and offensive to our aft Flight Attendant.I firmly believe that we need to emphasize to our pilots; and especially our Captains; that they 'are in charge' and we expect them to make the tough decisions; even if it's inconvenient or will cut into your hotel rest time. Our passengers expect no less; and our FAs deserve no less. Flying is not about just 'operating the plane' it also implies using your common sense and judgment and maturity to deal with incidents and situations that need to be dealt with; harshly at times; to prevent or avoid and unsafe situation later. I have been a pilot for over XX years; XY of those years as a Captain; and sometimes I wonder if we are still teaching our younger crews not just how to fly the nice TV screens; but how to make decisions. The FA related several prior events where young captains were not completely sure of what to do with passenger misbehavior; or if their potential action might 'upset the customer.' I humbly suggest that keeping the Captain firmly in charge; trained to expand his/her team by reaching outside his circle as necessary; and empowered to take whatever decisions are necessary to have a safe flight is highly important; even in this new world of highly advanced automation.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported returning to the gate to remove four passengers who were disruptive and refusing to comply with face mask policy.",

I told him; 'The mask must be on for boarding and remain on the entire flight covering your nose and mouth.' He put his paper mask on and asked where his seat was since he couldn't remember. I looked up his seat number and it was XX4. After he sat down he took his mask off again according to the aft flight attendants. FA1 and FA2 both instructed him to put his mask on covering his nose and mouth. He complied when asked; but then removed it again during walk through before takeoff. FA1 came forward and told me about taking his mask off again. He said he lost his mask so she brought him a new one from our kit and he put it on. After takeoff during service he again had his mask off. The aft flight attendants again told him he must cover his nose and mouth.After discussing his non-compliance repeatedly with the COVID-19 mask policy we decided the next time he had it off we would issue a final warning. About an hour before landing in ZZZ a couple [of] passengers came forward to complain about a man not wearing his mask at all. I went back to talk to him and it was Passenger X in XX4 again. He was making those around him uncomfortable and they said he would take the mask off as soon at the flight attendants would walk away. I issued him a warning and explained to him that this was his final warning about not wearing his mask. He said he lost his mask again. I went and got him a new mask out of the flight attendant kit and explained again that it must cover his nose and mouth. I instructed him to read the policy and that if he violated the mask policy again he would be reported and banned from flying on our airline. He put on his new mask and acknowledged that he understood. During final descent as I was sitting in my jumpseat and Passenger X leaned in the aisle and removed his mask. During taxi to the gate he stood up and started walking. I got on the PA and said 'Please; remain in your seat with seatbelts fastened with masks covering nose and mouth.'

When we reached the gate I informed the Customer Service Agent (CSA) about the situation. The CSA asked if we wanted the police; but we decided that since we were ready to deplane it wouldn't help.

I went to first class to talk to the A FA and she was talking to the passenger in X6. She asked the man how old his child was; he said 2 years and X months old. FA A informed him the child is required to wear a mask. The man then said the child was under 2.  The issue now was the child under 2 was seated in [his own seat]. (The father had purchased a seat for the child); I recommended that we just move the father and child to the row behind them. The couple seated in Y 1 and 3 were the grandparents so the father and child switched seats with them.I returned to the aft of the aircraft. I was later informed by FA A that the agents told her the child was over 2 years old. Throughout the flight I was in the first class cabin and the child never had a mask on. ALSO!! When I was doing my demo the grandmother who was seated in X6 did not have her nose covered. I asked her very kindly to cover her nose and she rolled her eyes and gave a big huff but did cover her nose. I was called to guard the flight deck door and she once again did not have her nose covered. I explained that she needed to cover her nose; once again she objected but complied. Only the First Officer (FO) used the lavatory and in that short time I had to ask her at least 4 times to cover her nose. She was so rude and resistant. I finally told her that I wouldn't stand guard if she didn't keep her mask on. The FO came out of the lavatory; I explained to the FO what was going on; the woman saw me talking to the FO and put her mask over her nose. FA A finally gave the father a warning. Other than the mom and Grandpa this family was seldom; the 2 year old Child never did wear a mask; in compliance with our Mask policy.   The child was 2 years that is why the father purchased a seat. Both parents lied about the age of the child when they found out the child was required to wear a mask. Which then required us to move the child from X4.",,"There's a family of four adults (parents and grandparents); a 2 year old and a baby. The 2 year old did not have his face mask on during boarding. I asked the father how old the child was. He said two and two months; I said that he had to have a mask on since he [was] over two.At that time the father said that his son was under two years old. The father grabbed his son and put him on his lap. His son was wiggling and fussing on his lap and finally he fell on the floor and screamed because of pain. He calmed down quickly; and still was sitting on dad's lap. (Later; during the flight the parents found a bleeding scratch on their son's back head and asked for First Aid antiseptic wipes.)The son looked like he was over 2 years old.  I asked the father what was the exact age of his son. He said that [he was] under Two. I had to call CSA and asked her to find out the exact age of the child. She found out that the child was over two years old. At that time I told the father that his son was not an infant; and he had to take his own seat and wear his face mask. The whole family were not happy with that; all the family members claimed the child was under two years old. Mother worried that they had purchased a seat for him and her son had to be on dad's lap. The father attempted to put a face mask on his son and he said that he would do his best to keep a face mask on during the flight. The family swapped seats.CSA came on board and asked if I wanted to remove the child from the flight. The father confirmed he would take all possible attempts to keep a face mask on his son. My decision was to keep the family on board.After 10;000 feet when I was taking the orders I saw that the boy did not have a mask on. I started talking to the father and he became not cooperative and talked to me in a rude manner. He said that his son was drinking water. I reminded him that the mask must be on when not actively eating or drinking. The father responded to me that I had to stay away from them; keep social distance (I did!); do not ask them any questions and do not offer them anything. At that time he actually was trying to make his son drink the water from the bottle in front of me. During the flight I was monitoring the child's compliance. He was watching his iPad and was not wearing a mask. I gave a warning to the father.During the rest of the flight the boy was not compliant. Parents put a bag of crackers in front of him to pretend he was actively eating.During the flight; with no mask on; they went to the lavatory in the aft (the forward lavatory was not operable). When they were coming back from the lavatory through the main cabin I was picking up trash and showed the father with my hands that mask must be on the child. The father ignored my request and just told me not to touch them. I talked to the Captain; explained the situation with the family who were not compliant and tried to hide the age of their child; and asked for a CSA to meet the flight in ZZZ. During demo and at cruising FA B had to ask grandmother to cover her nose many times. The grandmother was rolling her eyes when asked to cover her nose before we could let the pilots take a break. CSA met the flight in ZZZ and I reported the fact of hiding the child's age and the compliance issue to her.",,"Flight Attendant crew reported a family did not comply with face mask policy.",

He replied that he did not have one. I began to feel very uncomfortable as he was having trouble keeping his distance while also not having a face covering on. I told him if you can go get your face covering at your seat; we'd all really appreciate it and I'll get your waters and snacks ready in the meantime. He said again he did not have one. I told him that we will provide one for you no problem. So I had Flight Attendant (FA) A go and grab one for him and he slowly and reluctantly put it on. He started saying that it doesn't make sense that he was allowed to board without one. I specifically recalled him wearing one before and during taxiing out.He stood in the back galley and was now complying with wearing the mask and I gave him some waters and snacks. He asked for my name and badge number to file a complaint. I told him that this isn't anything personal or something to argue about; it's just our company's policy to wear a face covering and it's something that not only makes me feel comfortable but all the people around you. I also gave him my first name and the flight number. He started to tell me in an argumentative way that it is how I said for him to put his face mask on that was rude especially with asking him to take a step back when he wasn't wearing one at all. I told him that I had nicely asked him and now you're wearing one that we provided; thanks. He explained further that he thinks that I'm 'one of those people on the left.' I simply explained to him that I don't want to argue about this as this is simply just a policy that everyone on board must comply with; that's it! He tried to keep arguing with me and I replied that I'm not here to argue about this; or what I was asking you to do; I'm just grateful that you're now wearing your mask; so thank you. He kept insisting that the crew today is terrible and that he wants to file a complaint. He also kept mentioning that he wasn't wearing one during boarding. Something felt a little off about him; I kept insisting that this is our policy and that we appreciate his compliance. No warning was necessary because the guest complied with wearing the mask from the point when I provided one.The guest claimed he was not wearing a face mask when boarding; even though I recall seeing him wear one.

It is also something that's included in our announcement before departure and our welcoming/safety announcement. When working AFT I actively check for mask; bag; and seat belt compliance prior to closure of the boarding door. I also ask the flight deck to make an announcement regarding face masks and to ensure coverage of both nose and mouth is included so that we are all unified.

Flight Attendant B asked her to put the mask on and the passenger said she can't talk on the phone through a mask. Flight Attendant B insisted and the woman begrudgingly put the mask on. As I passed by the passenger she was again not wearing the mask and speaking on her phone. I stood by the seat in front of her waiting for a good break in the conversation for a time to talk with her and she wrapped up the conversation and said sorry and put the phone away. I told her it wasn't an issue with the phone; but the health and safety of those around her. She put her mask on. Shortly thereafter as we were preparing the cabin for departure I noticed her mask was below her nose. She was wearing her headphones and did not hear me; but when she saw me she pulled the mask up over her nose. Based on the attitude she gave Flight Attendant B and the fact that the mask was off again when I came by; and then not properly worn a third time Flight Attendant B and I concurred that if we had to speak with her again it would merit a disciplinary action. We also told the flight deck this; so that they would be aware. Throughout the flight we did have close eyes on her; as one does when a passenger has already exhibited behavior that is against the rules; but I tried not to hound on her. During service I saw her and some others wearing their mask below their nose or off in the long times between sips and I made a PA asking everyone to be compliant (in no way singling her out).Once it came time for final compliance for landing I came back through and again her mask was fully below her nose. I stopped and kneeled down and told her that we had already spoken with her about the mask and that wearing it under the nose does not comply. During the conversation that followed she did not pull her mask over her nose until after I had walked away.She told me that she has a medical condition that makes her light headed and that she has been doing her best with the mask. I told her that while for several months we had mask exemptions for medical cases for the last month it has been mandatory regardless of individual. She asked me for my full name and asked if she could take a picture of my name tag. I told her I was not comfortable giving my last name but if she reached out to the company they would know who I was. She said that I was rude for hounding her and briefly said the word 'Nazi' in reference to my strict adherence to the mask policy and 'targeting' of her.The specifics of timing between what was said during this conversation and what was said in the conversation after I brought disciplinary action and later during final compliance all kind of meld; but these things were said.She said that it was wrong to single out people who have medical conditions and that they don't have to share what the condition is. I reminded her that at no point did I ask her what her condition is and that she only shared that she had a condition at the end of the flight after things came to a head. I also explained again that regardless of condition the mask policy is for anyone who wants to fly.Some guests in the nearby rows thanked me for sticking to the policy as they had had concerns with the passenger in question not wearing her mask throughout the flight. I did my best to thank them for their support; but also to not rile up the non-compliant passenger nor the woman across the aisle who seemed to have befriended and come to the passenger's side (however this woman never spoke up to me or in my earshot). I did not want to put passengers against each other or cause more disruption.Passenger also said that she was not planning on flying [Airline] ever again. We let the Captain know [of the situation] and he called ahead to have a Supervisor meet passenger. During deplaning several of the other passengers that were in surrounding seats and had spoken up again thanked me for the way I handled the situation and said they'd be writing in to the company.",,"Passenger was sitting in seat XX1.

Then I informed another FA and told him to keep an eye on her and then he immediately walked through the cabin and she had it off again; not even one minute later. So he also asked her to put it on. After safety demo passenger had mask on but not covering her nose FA A asked her to pull it up and make sure it is covering both her nose and mouth.Inflight there were times she took exaggerated time to eat and drink. As were others in the cabin so we made a PA; (overall I bet we made 20 mask policy PAs during the entire flight).Then during descent FA A observed her with it off again. I seen him having a conversation with her so I approached and he mentioned to her the policy and the reasons and the procedure and then told her he would be back.He said she said she knows the policy. And around that time she mentioned to him that she was trying her best but she has a medical condition. She continued to argue with him and ask for his name to file a complaint. Passengers in front of and behind her gave thanks to FA A for enforcing the policy and said he handled it well. I do believe she overheard them praising him.

I asked more about this; feeling a little concerned as to what could have caused them to deny him boarding these previous days and if it could be an issue during the flight. They told me the previous days he had not wanted to board the plane. He had explained to them that he hadn't gotten sleep and also hadn't eaten. I'm not sure what happened those past few days but it was communicated that he had gotten enough sleep and was able to finally board the plane.I made sure to ask clearly if they thought there might be any issue during the flight or if there was anything I should know that could cause an issue in-flight. The agent I talked to said she thought he was harmless.During boarding a woman nearby asked if he was going to wear his mask. I looked over and he had it down at his chin. I asked him to put it on and he did. This was an ongoing issue during the flight - he kept taking it off and we had to keep asking/reminding him to put it on.While taxiing to takeoff he got up out of his seat and moved a few rows back. I alerted the Captain but by this time he was already seated back down. We took off. I had him move back to sit in his original seat and he seemed fine the rest of the flight.   Right before takeoff while we were still taxiing; [he] got up out of his seat and moved back a few rows to the exit row. I called the Captain and let him know someone was out of his seat. By this time [he] was seated a few rows back. The pilot made an announcement that everyone needed to be in their seat and then we took off. We just continued with taking off when we were scheduled. The thing is; [he] was now seated in an exit row for takeoff and he had not been briefed to sit there. I also doubted his ability to perform the necessary exit row duties. Once we were up in the air I did go back and confirmed that [he] was now seated in an exit row. I had him move back to his original row where he stayed for the duration of the flight. The only other issues we had was that when I would walk by he wasn't always wearing his mask. I would remind him and he would put it on. He seemed not to be intentionally doing it but perhaps just not mentally 'all there.'More communication from CSA to CSA. When we arrived in ZZZ1 I alerted the gate agent that we had a meet and assist and the D FA pointed him out to the gate agent as he deplaned. I don't think the extent of the situation had been communicated. Then again it's not our job to babysit people. Maybe his family should have been contacted and asked to fly with him?

I tried to be deliberate and methodical in reviewing the manual after discovering the error before performing the alignment and thought I had found the only pertinent caution; the flaps/slats. The format of the manual made it appear to me that the section was complete on page X. Only suggestion would be to keep all cautions and warnings for a given section grouped together in the text; instead of having one at the start of the section and another at the end of the section (in this case on the next page).The First Officer (FO) and I discussed the threats and errors that occurred on this morning and the opportunities that I missed to capture those errors. We additionally thoroughly reviewed the system. I take away a number of lessons learned from this morning and will be more vigilant when I recognize when my habit patterns are interrupted.Other potential considerations:My FO and I had briefed the entire trip that he was low time (just over 100 hours) and I had not flown in 5 weeks.  While I felt rested and alert; this was day 4 of a 23 hour trip with all early morning shows which may have also contributed to a decreased capacity.  My cockpit preparation flow was interrupted when a passenger; who had refused to pay for his carry-on bag; breached the gate in ZZZ and caused a disturbance at the forward door. I got out of my seat to see what was going on and prepare to close the door should things escalate. When I returned; I thought I had finished my flow completely but after pushback and engine start realized I had not turned on IRS3 when we got an ADR3 fault caution message.Knowing that there were warnings and conditions about aligning IRS's outside of the normal preflight I opened page X which has the ADIRS preflight information. The caution on that page said to make sure the flaps and slats were retracted before aligning; which was confirmed before I turned on IRS3. Since there was a GPS outage in our area; and we had moved in the pushback after aligning IRS1 and IRS2 I also decided to do another full alignment of those. When I selected all of the ADIRS off we got a master warning for the ADIRS 1+2+3 fail and other cautions which all resolved after I turned them on to align again. Knowing we had gotten out of our normal flow; and recognizing that I had gotten distracted with gate issue; during the alignment the FO and I went through the preflight items and reviewed our previous work to confirm we had not missed anything else. After the alignment was complete and all systems normal we departed for an otherwise uneventful flight. Once in cruise; I went back to review the manual and found on the next page Y a continuation of the ADIRS section with an additional second bullet point; one that said not to align the ADIRS with the engines running.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported making a procedural error during preflight and cited a distraction and lack of recent flying as contributing factors.",

I informed him it was mandatory to wear the mask and if he was not able to comply with safety instructions that it would be addressed at that time not during the flight.  He cursed at me; at that time his female traveling companion told him to stop and to listen.  She said he would comply with crew member instructions.

And obviously if it did anything; we would actually follow it.  I keep praying this is over tomorrow. I have the lawyer that is saying this is crimes against humanity.

I was in the back; waiting for the aisle to clear so I could close the overhead bins and brief exit rows. I noticed the customer was in the galley speaking with the forward FA. I wasn't sure what her seat was; so I waited for her to go to her seat before I started walking forward and closing the bins. She grabbed her bag from row X and then sat in XYA; the exit row. I just assumed that was her assigned seat at the time. I closed the bins all the way to the front. I noticed a pilot commuting in row Z who had his mask around his chin and wasn't eating. I requested he put his mask back up and he did. The man behind him in X4 had his mask completely off; so I asked him to put it on and he did. When I asked that guy to put his on; another customer across also pulled theirs up; so I didn't have to ask that third person. I don't recall where the third person was sitting; I only remember they sat in [the area] on the left side of the aircraft. They put their mask up before I asked; so I didn't think much of that.I was quite annoyed that I had to remind so many customers to put their masks up. I briefed the exits like normal. After the door was closed and I did my compliance checks; other flight attendant motioned me toward her before the safety demo. She said that the woman who moved to the exit row was originally seated in [in a different area]; and that many customers had their masks off in that area; so she requested to move else where; and that's why she moved. I told other Flight Attendant that I did notice a lot more than usual with their masks off or down; especially in those first few rows of [that area]. Especially the [commuting] pilot and the guy behind him. Other flight attendant said the woman said something about a crew member not wearing a mask. There were a few flight attendants commuting; too; but they all had their masks on that I knew of. Later; inflight I spoke to the woman who moved; and I apologized and told her that it was not okay that they weren't wearing their masks; and that I did tell them to put them on and they did. She said she was especially appalled that a pilot wasn't wearing one; and said she was traveling to see a family member and was stressed enough. I gave her [a voucher] and offered her wine or beer; which she would have gotten in her [original] seat anyway. She seemed calmer and thanked me a lot.Later; I spoke with the [commuting] pilot and reminded him the importance of wearing masks around customers; and that one did move herself back because he wasn't wearing his. After I told him the first time (before door was closed) to put it back on; he kept it on except when eating or drinking. The man behind him; however; I told twice more (three times total including before door was closed) to put his mask on. Once inflight when I was collecting trash and he was sleeping. He had his mask all the way below his chin; near the collar of his shirt so that it didn't even look like he had one there. And another before landing; when I was doing my final compliance check. There was another guy in main cabin who fell asleep twice and I had to shake him awake and remind him to put his mask up; but his was covering his mouth; it just wasn't over his nose. I checked on the customer in XYA again and told her I spoke with that pilot again; and he has complied with mask requirement since the door was closed. Hopefully he just forgot and takes the mask requirement seriously. I only told him once; so I'm not sure how long he had it off or if he was eating before and just forgot to put it back on. I spoke with flight deck before I spoke with that commuter because our paper work and guest service tool app did not say there was a non-rev seated in Z4. So I asked FD if maybe he was listed as jumpseater; which didn't make sense because there were enough seats for all the non-revs to get on and he had higher priority. So I told FD about the customer complaint about that commuting pilot. When I spoke with him; he said he asked gate agent for a seat without the bulkhead; since he was originally given seat A3. So it seemed the woman who was seated in Z3; was swapped to A3. And the pilot was moved to Z4. I'm not sure exactly.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported that many passengers; including a commuting pilot; were not compliant with the face mask policy.",

I told them once we're finished boarding we can see if there's empty seats or you can talk to the gate agent if not. One of them sits across in XX4 for time being. Customer Service Agent (CSA) comes on and says someone else is assigned that seat. He goes back to see who should be in that seat; comes back and finds him sitting in row XY next to someone; I guess they knew each other. So the other customer stays in XX4.The customer in Y2 was also seated next to a stranger; and asked about moving up to row 1. I said unfortunately because we have seating caps; first class is at its max up there. I said once CSA comes back you can talk to him. I go to get a trash bag to collect the purell wipes; and he's right behind me when I turn around. I was confused why he was there all of a sudden. He said he would go talk to the gate agent. I told him to make sure he has all his bags if he's stepping off; but didn't understand why he didn't just wait for GA to come back. Because he had to come back to sort out the customers in row XX. And he asked why he had to take his things; thinking that meant he'd miss the flight. I asked why not just wait in your seat until the gate agent comes back; and he calmed down and nodded; saying that's a better idea. I guess he didn't hear me when I initially told him to wait for CSA to come back. Then CSA comes on and finishes sorting [out] XX12. Then he talks to Y2 and says exactly what I told him about seat caps; maybe he told him something more I'm not sure. Y2 kept complaining about the whole row 1 being open; and why can't he sit there; as if nobody explained the covid seating caps to him (both me and CSA did).Then; I finish collecting wipes and notice XX2 has a lace mask. Like lacey dress or underwear material; super thin with holes in it. And I ask if she has a regular mask without holes; or we can give one to her. And she has a startled/insulted look on her face; and says how she needs the holes because 'I can only breathe out of my left nostril.' I told her if it's a medical concern; it's not showing up on our end; and we weren't informed of any passengers with medical exceptions. So we would need to talk to the CSA and get that on your booking; so you can get an exception. And then she says how she flew with that mask from ZZZ; and it was fine. I told her it was possible nobody noticed on those flights; and unfortunately it's not allowed. Even if nobody else noticed before; that doesn't mean I can ignore it when I notice.So I go back up and flag down the CSA as he's closing the jetbridge doors. And I ask him about any medical exceptions; and he said nobody was approved for that and that he didn't notice anyone with a lace mask. So he says he'll be back with a mask. We have masks onboard but it was better he did that because she was already giving me attitude about it. He comes back and asks who it was and I said XX2; one of the ones we were talking with earlier. He goes back and gives her the mask and comes back saying how she told him that she wore that mask from ZZZ and I that he told her that it doesn't matter what happened on previous flights. Basically the same stuff from when I spoke to her.She got past him during boarding; then the other FA up front; then me in back during the whole seat issue; and then the GA again when he helped with the seat issue. And it wasn't until near departure time that I even noticed. So I think there's a good chance that on her other flights; those CSAs and FAs didn't notice either.Also; it was obvious she didn't have a medical exemption because she told me she needs a hole-y mask since she can only breathe out of 1 nostril. What I did not tell her was that she was speaking to a FA who hasn't been able to breathe out of either nostril in years because of a medical issue; and I was wearing a regular mask just fine. Iwould feel blessed if I could breathe out of even just one nostril. Somehow she didn't think that breathing out of one's mouth alone is possible in a mask. And I know I'm not the only FA with a similar sinus issue; too; and we all wear regular masks.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported that several passengers had seat location issues and another passenger was not wearing a proper face mask.",

As I'm saying this she has it pinched between her finger pulled away from her face. She snapped back; 'It's there or it's covering' something along those lines and dismissively continued her conversation with the woman across from her. When I walked to the front of the plane before the demo I told the woman in XX3 to follow the mask policy so XX4 knew we were enforcing it. After my first encounter I informed the crew that I already talked to her and received attitude back and for them to keep an eye out.My second encounter was shortly after that when I went to pass out the [snacks] to the family next to her. As I walked up the mask again was down below her nose and when she saw me there she moved it up. I told her I really need her to keep the mask up and she snapped that it was up. I said it wasn't a moment ago and that I didn't want to have any issues on this long flight. Her responses to that was did I know that the politicians didn't believe in masks and I told her that this wasn't political; it was me doing my job to enforce our policy. She continued to give me attitude and talking about it was political. I went to the back and informed Flight Attendant (FA) C and D how my second encounter went and that she would be an issue the remainder of the flight and I strongly believe we should give her the Warning. They both offered to be the one to talk and give it to her. Flight Attendant C took care of that.While passing out the snack mix; I got to the row the husband was in. He asked for the wife's snack and his mask was down and FA D asked him to make sure his mask was up. XX4 had some kind of response that I missed but FA D told her not to have attitude towards us when we were just doing our job. Then she responded as a victim; saying she's been yelled at the whole flight and that she has been talking to us respectfully and not yelling at us. Which is not the truth because my encounters with her were very unpleasant; disrespectful and had the intent to belittle me and the policy.The remainder of the flight the entire family didn't comply with the mask policy. Their son rarely had the mask on when I passed; the daughters below their nose and the husband as well even though he would pull it up as we passed by. We all spoke to the family at one point and most of us multiple times. The mother was constantly having the mask below her nose or pulling the mask away from her face as she spoke to her kids and the woman across from her.

Once everyone was settled and I was able to move toward the front of the cabin I approached the passenger who was seated in seat XX3 and I told her she must put her mask on over her nose and mouth. She has the mask under her chin. I then noticed the child seated in XX4 did not have on a mask at all. I then asked passenger seated in XX3 (the mother) "How old is your daughter?' She then responded "She's four (4)' I then told her that the little girl had to wear a mask as well. She immediately told me 'No; she doesn't like that and how do I expect her to breathe?' The little girl was very aggressive towards the mother and began yelling at her and telling her 'No; No; Nooooooooo....'

I politely explained to the mother the company's policy and she then said 'Ok' She pulled out the child's mask from her pocket and placed it on her face. The little girl snatched the mask off; threw it on the floor and yelled out 'NOOOOOOOO!' in her mother's face. I told the Captain what was going on and gave him full details.So once the door closed and we did our safety demo and was sitting waiting to push back both passengers seated in seat XX3 and XX4 had their mask down and off. I went back to her and told her (the mother) that she had to keep her mask on. She looked at me and rolled her eyes and she put the mask back up on her face. I offered to give her another mask (that are provided on the aircraft) she said 'No!' The passenger seated in the exit row seat looked surprised and began shaking their heads at her (the mother & child's behavior) The child was not listening to her mother and she kept screaming at her. The mother was trying to negotiate with the child but she was not paying her any attention. I told the Captain and he told me to go back to the passenger and tell her that they must wear the mask or we will re-open the door and have them removed from the aircraft. She then responded 'Ok; we will keep it on.'

At this point I issued a policy violation to her and as she was reading it she began to challenge me on the wording of the card. She said the violation stated kids two (2) did not have to wear a mask. I was confused because the child was four (4) going on five (5). This passenger was trying to find reason as to why her child should not wear a mask or why she could have her mask under her chin or top lip.

Passenger boarded the plane without wearing a mask and took a seat in X1. The Fwd FA approached and reminded passenger about the required mask policy. Passenger reluctantly complied and as the FA turned to walk away; the passenger called her an '[expletive]'. After the FA informed us about this; I first asked the FA if passenger is being disruptive. The FA stated that passenger was not. I then asked if she would like me to go speak to the passenger. The FA stated that was not necessary. Finally; I asked if she would like me to request a customer service representative. The FA again said no; the situation is under control and she would let us know if the problem continues. I messaged my Dispatcher to keep them in the loop of what was said. We pushed; de-iced; and while taxing to our assigned runway; I asked the FO to call and make sure there were no further issues in the back. The FA stated that the passenger had fallen asleep; so we elected to continue. About mid-way through the flight; the Fwd FA called up and stated that the passenger had woken up and was starting to cause some disturbances. The FO was already the PF and I asked him to take radios as well. The passenger asked for a cup of water so passenger didn't have to wear the mask because she was 'drinking'. The FAs let this go on for about '30 minutes' (quoting them) and the passenger had not drank any of the water. Passenger again was non-compliant with the mask and both FAs asked passenger three times to wear the mask. At this point; I sent another message asking for a customer service representative to meet us at the gate in ZZZ1 and explained to the Dispatcher everything the FAs had told me. About 5 minutes after that; the Fwd FA called up again. Again; I told the FO his controls; his radios. The FA then explained that the passenger was now starting to 'scream' on the plane and yelled very loudly; '#@%^! I'm not from [foreign country]!' While doing this; proceeded to flip off both FAs. I again messaged our Dispatcher with this information and now requested Security along with the customer service representative. The FAs and I talked back forth regarding passenger danger level. The passenger was remaining in the seat and making no other threatening gestures; so we did not see the need to declare an Emergency. We continued the flight to ZZZ1 with no further incidences. After landing; I had the FO call Ops just to make sure a customer service representative and security were waiting for us at the gate. Upon arrival into the gate; a customer service representative and security officer where indeed right there. The customer service representative immediately came onto the plane and removed the passenger.The FAs did not make any indication and no one told me they suspected the passenger was drunk. Seems as if passenger was just a genuinely disturbed person.We probably should have gotten security or customer service involved at ZZZ because of the name calling. Because the passenger had put on the mask and was making no further threatening behavior; we decided to make a note of it and continue. We all agreed though; that if passenger made one more derogatory comment; we would most likely be removing passenger from the flight.

Then when I get the 10;000 I get up to kindly ask him to place mask over nose and mouth; he complies and then as I walk away he takes it off. I let him know one more time announcements say. He doesn't comply and wife [has] her mask off too; to tell me why don't I leave him alone. At this point I head towards forward to inform pilots and they let me know to let him know one last time.

That is how I noticed the X Family was a party of 4. The mother was holding the child and I asked if the child was a seat or a lap as I didn't have her as a lap child in my list; but in her own seat. She said she has her own seat. And I asked if she was over 2 years. The mother said yes. I asked if they had a mask for the child reminding them of our policy and also reiterated that the child would need to be in her own seat for takeoff (FAR); landing and whenever the seat belt sign was on. The father stated that she's only two. I said yes; she's over two that's why she's required to have and be in her own seat. The father also said they were traveling internationally. (I believed they were traveling internationally when we got to ZZZ; but later in this situation the Supervisor who spoke to the family ascertained that they had come in from ZZZZ on Aircraft Y; where apparently the situation was not addressed on that flight).I offered to bring a mask and did. I informed the Purser and cockpit that there was both issues. While I was closing bins I walked past the family and they had made no attempt to rectify the situation. I also had to remind the father twice to fix his own mask. When there was no attempt to address the non masked child by the family I chat text for a Supervisor to address the situation since the door was open. The first Supervisor went to the seat and was there for a few seconds; I was concerned that it didn't appear the situation was addressed by the reaction of the family. The child still didn't have a mask on and no motion to attempt. I approached the Supervisor and asked him about it. He said he told the family. I informed him that I walked by their row and the child wasn't wearing a mask nor was there any attempt to get the child to wear one. The purser also spoke to the family.Another Supervisor came; and spoke to the family. I stayed at the front of the cabin to let them deal with the situation. Supervisor 2; Inflight supervisor came as we were now taking a delay.Supervisor 2 said that they could make an exception to the mask policy.I; as an employee who is required to be masked with verbalized and written termination warning from my company if I do not remained masked at work; is now telling me that exceptions can be made onboard the aircraft for passengers. I have never heard of this and am not aware of documentation of this.The passenger knows the child isn't allowed to be a lap child and they know that anyone over two is required to be masked.While I realize it's difficult for a young child I also acknowledge that Airline chose to pick this age for mask requirement likely to coincide with the FAA mandated age seat requirement. There is ample notification for these policies (during booking and check in); passengers personal responsibility is a choice. As is proactive parenting. After more than two decades of flying there are quite frankly cultural differences/ beliefs of non-compliance and this presents itself as complete lack of acknowledgment of our policies (or FAR's). I completely acknowledge that the flying public is a challenge at times; most follow the rules. This includes me; especially at work. While I'm completely capable of sympathy; compassion and compromise... I'm absolutely not when it comes to safety.I applaud Airline for enforcing the mask policy. I would encourage them to strive for consistency on a multitude of other safety issues that appear at times to go by the wayside in favor of on time departures and convenience. It is this mentality that creates inconsistencies and quite frankly makes my job harder to do.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported issues with a family of four who had a 2 year old who did not want to wear a face mask.",

We elected to remove the battery and transport it in the passenger cabin to ensure we had access do it during flight.

The First Officer and I had completed a bathroom rotation just before starting down into ZZZ when we got a call from the flight attendants informing us they were [having problems with this passenger].

I told the First Officer what I was considering and why; and asked if he had any considerations.  He agreed that was a good choice.  I then requested priority handling with ZZZ approach and informed them of SOB and fuel remaining.  I had sent an ACARS message to Dispatch informing them of our situation.  I called ZZZ ops and informed them of the same.  I then checked in with the flight attendants to ensure things were okay; which they were.  I informed them we were accepting priority handling and would be on the ground as soon as possible.  As we passed through 10;000 feet we kept the speed up around 315 knots to expedite our arrival.  We were given radar vectors to a visual Runway X and landed uneventfully.  We had to wait a few minutes for our gate as it was occupied.  We pulled into the gate.  The passenger disembarked and the situation was over.  There were no injuries.  After the plane was empty the crew got together in the front of the airplane for a debrief of the situation.  At the end of the debrief I asked the flight attendants if they were okay and would be comfortable with continuing.  They all felt that they were okay to continue.  When the First Officer and I debriefed; I asked him the same and he was good.  I took a moment to assess myself and determined I was good to continue as well.It is worth noting that the flight attendants did a very good job of keeping us informed as to the status of the situation.

I guess noticing that FA B and myself are talking to the Captain inflight; Passenger X states to FA B he now wants to read the policy. Once seeing the policy and reading it Passenger X states to FA B that he's sorry. FA B then calls the Captain to let him know Passenger X has a change of heart.

On the ground after landing; I learned from the flight attendants that there had been a problem with a passenger. They initially described it as a medical issue; saying prior to departure the CSR had struggled to evaluate if he was fit to fly and eventually decided he was. I was told he was the last passenger to board. There were issues with him not wearing his mask properly and several crew members had asked him to cover his nose. He was seated in the wrong seat prior to departure. At one point he was coughing/hacking severely to the point where other passengers began to react with concern. On the return back to ZZZ; two flight attendants said he was unresponsive when they asked him to put his seat and tray table upright. They said they had to resort to physically shaking him before he responded; They asked him if he knew his name and where he was going and he either would not or could not provide this information; but eventually just said he was 'going home.'When he was pointed out to me in the terminal prior to the 'second' flight; on a new aircraft; and his mask was down below his nose. The flight attendants were very concerned and did not want him on our flight because he would not obey crew member instructions. I agreed the situation would likely not improve once airborne and did not want to risk yet another diversion if that it indeed turned out to be the case and therefore told Customer Service not to board the passenger.I told one CSR he would not be allowed on the flight. As we prepared the new aircraft for departure I was confronted by yet another CSR Supervisor who again tried to talk me into taking him. 'We're out of options. There are no more flights out. He's crying. He's very nice. He just wants to go home.' I was moved; but the unruly passengers are always nice to the agents when they're on the ground trying to make up for bad behavior and I had to remember that every Flight Attendant in the back; to a person; had an issue with this passenger and did not feel comfortable taking him. I stood my ground.  The FAA adopted a Zero Tolerance policy earlier this month.

I identified myself to the A Flight Attendant (FA) (as I always do) as a safety and security asset.The flight was nearly full.  During boarding a man who I later learned was Mr. X approached my seat.  He was wearing a camo gaiter around his neck which was partially covering his mouth but was not covering his nose. As he approached; I identified myself as a crew member and politely asked him to pull his mask up over his nose.  He complied but said that I should pinch my mask tight over my nose.  I didn't quite hear what he said so I queried him.  He said; 'You should pinch down on your nose to close the gap at the top of your mask.'   My mask was an NP95 which had no gaps anywhere around my face.  It was my sense that the man was being sarcastic and antagonistic.  I said nothing further to him.I advised the FA A what happened before we pushed back.  She told me that the man had boarded without his face covered and was told to cover his face.  Thus he had pulled his face covering off his face between the time he boarded (when he was told to put it on) and the time he approached me; which was no more than thirty seconds. He clearly had no intention of complying with the mask policy.  FA A asked me to brief the Captain about the incident and asked if I would talk to the CSR agent whom she wanted to speak with Mr. X. I agreed.  Before departure I walked into the jet bridge and spoke with FA A and the CSR.  I briefly explained what I observed and what he said to me then I went back onto the airplane and took my seat.  A short time later I observed Mr. X walk back down the aisle past me.Sometime during the flight FA A advised me that Mr. X had been [violating other regulations].  She advised me that Mr. X demanded to know the crews names (including mine) but that she did not give him any names. She was clearly concerned about this and I could see how his actions were distracting to the flight crew and were thus interfering with their duties.  She told me that she was going to have CS meet the aircraft and asked me to stay as a witness.  FA A as well as the rest of the inflight crew were nothing but polite and professional the entire flight; when I observed her dealing with Mr. X or otherwise.After leaving the aircraft I was standing in the jet bridge and spoke with a CS Supervisor.  Mr. X walked by me and said in an aggressive and hostile tone; 'I want your name.'  I told him that I could not give it to him and that I could not speak with him about this matter.  He again demanded my name and moved closer to me.  I backed up.  He then raised his camera and said; 'I'm taking your picture.'  I stated; 'Do not take my picture.'  He said; I'm taking your picture.'  I quickly turned around and walked around the jet bridge corner toward the aircraft door.   I do not know if he took my photograph or not but felt that his forcing his camera in my face was one of belligerence; hostility; and aggression.  I felt threatened.  All of this simply because he was asked to properly wear his mask.  After the CSR Supervisor and Mr. X walked into the terminal; I remained in the jet bridge as I did not want to encounter Mr. X again.When the CSR Supervisor walked back onto the jet bridge; I explained to her that I could not have my photograph taken and suggested that if he loitered around the terminal waiting for me that she please call law enforcement.  I asked her if she felt he was being hostile and or belligerent.  She agreed that he was.  After some time; Mr. X left the area; and I departed the terminal.Based on his behavior and actions I would strongly urge that Mr. X is not allowed to fly on our airline in the future.",,,,"Air carrier Captain deadheading on a company flight reported a passenger would not conform to the face mask policy and was hostile; aggressive; belligerent towards the flight attendants.",

Started taxing in ZZZ alley when I got a call from #1 Flight Attendant; (FA); that there were First Class; FC; passengers that were not wearing face coverings after being told to wear them by the FAs. Stopped the aircraft and made a very 'To the point' PA that any non-compliance with Flight Attendant instructions; particularly pertaining to facial coverings; would have 'un-favorable' consequences. I had already made it clear that facial coverings were required while on-board during my 'welcome aboard' PA. Conferred with FAs that my second PA was successful; and we continued taxi and takeoff. Once established in cruise; the FAs informed me that they were having problems with FC passengers willfully being non-compliant regarding wearing a facial covering after being advised as such multiple times by at least 2 different FAs. My FAs had even switched working positions in order to try to de-escalate the situation and convince the passengers to comply. I commenced communication with Dispatch and relayed the situation with advisement to contact customer representatives. Shortly thereafter; due not only to non-mask wearing; but also; disruptive behavior by passengers requested to be re-seated in Main Cabin. I further relayed this information to Dispatch. It was at this point the FAs gave the notification of passenger misconduct warning. Shortly thereafter passenger started harassing my FAs with constant cornering them in the FC galley and demanding trivial items.

The temperature in the back of the plane was stifling - it had to be 95 degrees Fahrenheit in the plane. I told my forward Flight Attendant (FA) and we reported to Captain. Passengers were allowed to board and they immediately began taking off as many clothing layers as possible. FAA and company regulations still require everyone to wear masks; despite CDC warnings that masks should be removed when overheated. As the AFT FA; I am responsible for making announcements in a mask; which is laborious and requires many more breathing pauses than usual. Saying the announcements with a mask; in ridiculous heat is more; exhausting; distracting; and physically concerning. My only focus was being able to breathe and the health of my passengers. I walked to the front of aircraft to get some air; but also to get water for the poor passengers. Thankfully; the plane did cool off in the air; but it was still extremely uncomfortable.Extreme heat conditions on the airplane combined with mandatory mask compliance for passengers and crew caused this event.  Crews can be terminated/lose benefits if removing masks on board the aircraft in front of passengers. Until recently; FA's were not required to wear masks while making announcements. Passengers can be fined/lose flight privileges for removing masks. The threat of the FAA fines and penalties under the new federal mask mandate appears to supersede common sense safety practices and concern and care for crews and passengers.Masks; may help prevent viral spread (there is much data to refute those claims); but prevents the passengers and crew to breathe much needed fresh oxygen. The effects of not getting enough oxygen and the potential for hypoxia were ingrained into me during FA training. I am greatly concerned that airlines and the FAA are continuing to put the safety of passengers and crew at risk with mandatory mandates that restrict fresh oxygen; which can cloud judgement and critical thinking abilities. Heat exhaustion and the need for fresh oxygen when wearing masks was acknowledged by the CDC. Of course; the CDC recommended spacing of self 6 feet away; but plane passengers and crew do not have the luxury of a 6 foot distance. Mandatory mask mandates on planes should also come with the ability to tell passengers and crew to remove masks when feeling anxious or stressed or when breathing is compromised. If one feels sick or faint because of heat and a mask; the ability to lower a mask on a plane should be allowed. FAs should be empowered to use their common sense when enforcing masks in extreme heat conditions. The 'appearance of safety' seems to be aviation's new standard of practice rather than 'actual safety' of anyone on board an aircraft. This is a very serious shift in thought for the FAA and airlines.  The unintended consequences of these 'appearance of safety' standards are frightening.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported concern for passenger health regarding the face mask policy when the aircraft is on the ground with little or no air circulation and the cabin is hot.",

I only knew she was on the phone because her phone was facing up in her palm and I could see the active phone call with the phone screen. She seemed to act like she was complying; but she was still talking. Her mic for the phone was inside of her mask; so I would never have been able to say she was on the phone had I not seen the phone. I told the forward she was still on the phone.People hide their cell phone microphones in the masks all the time. It is hard to tell when they are actively talking or just singing along to a tune.If it is so hard for me to discern an active phone call is taking place with a passengers face covered;  I have to wonder what else people can hide inside a mask that could cause me; fellow passengers; crew or the plane harm. 3D printers can make all kinds of gadgets - including sharp objects - that could hide in a mask; not to mention the possibility of any kind of explosive that could be detonated between the teeth.COVID masks - supposedly are for crew and passenger safety; but these federal masks on airplanes create more safety concerns. I know the masks appear to keep us safe from the dreaded COVID; but the reality is the masks pose a much greater safety risk than COVID. I can't see what people are actually doing (talking on the phone or not). I can't identify a human trafficking victim from any other masked passenger. I can't identify a bad actor hiding in a mask from an innocent one in a mask.

I made our announcement. Just prior to going through sterile flight deck period the Flight Attendant called again with passenger seat numbers X3 and YX4 and asked me to relay non mask compliance to the station. We made several attempts to contact Operations. After being unable to do so I sent an ACARS to Dispatch notifying them of mask non-compliance and asked them to have a CSR meet the aircraft. Being so close to the destination we elected to continue to the destination. After landing we tried several more times to contact Operations on taxi in and were unable to do so. Upon arriving at the gate the CSR came on board and informed me they had LEOs waiting at the counter and the TSA had been notified but she wasn't sure if they were sending a representative to speak with the passengers. She requested keeping the passengers on board for several minutes; so they could make sure everyone was prepared to receive the passengers. Given the all clear; the passengers disembarked without incident.The Flight Attendant mentioned she made multiple announcements and handed the passengers the information describing the penalties for non-compliance that are included in the packs of masks/alcohol wipes. It sounds like she made every available effort per SOP to have the passengers comply with the mask mandate. As states continue to withdraw mask mandates I foresee this becoming an increasingly widespread issue. I thought the idea of handing the passengers the information card was a very smart idea as seeing this in writing may carry more weight. Perhaps aircraft can be stocked with additional copies of these cards to hand out. Also our current guidance on the mask mandates in the flight crew memo make this policy sound like it is just per company policy. Updated guidance stating that this is a Federal mandate may make it more clear to the passengers that this is a serious federal violation. Every day we see passengers wearing masks that are not allowed on our flights and have to be given masks the meet standards; gate agents policing masks that required standard would also be helpful.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported passengers not conforming with face mask policy during flight and had personnel meet the aircraft on arrival.",

During the swap; the outgoing Captain informed me that the Crew that brought the aircraft into ZZZ1 said that upon landing the right thrust reverser malfunctioned. The delay was due to Contract Maintenance MEL'ing the right thrust reverser. During pre-flight I checked the logbook; Release; and stickers as well as looked up the MEL on my EFB. During this time the 'A' Flight Attendant informed me that a passenger was refusing to wear their mask and creating a scene and that the CSR had been called. Eventually the passenger was removed and an updated report was sent to the aircraft. During the distraction I neglected to click on the hyperlink in the MEL in the Maintenance portion labeled MEL SP#XX Thrust Reverser System. If I had I would have noticed on that a Circuit Breaker for the #2 Engine should have been pulled and collared. Upon landing in ZZZ2 I informed the outgoing Captain of the MEL.

The MEL number was not entered; the Special procedures performed were not entered and the circuit breakers pulled and collared were not entered.   When I reviewed the logbook entry; the special procedures were references SP-XX.  I also observed C/B's  #2 Engine TR Sync Lock and #2 Engine TR INTLK pulled and collared.I then reviewed the MEL and SP-XX and discovered the following errors.1. SP XX calls for the #2 Engine TR Sync Lock c/b and the #2 Engine TR Control c/b to be pulled and collared.  the Control C/B was NOT collared as prescribed in SP XXnd the INTLK c/b WAS collared contrary to SP XX2.

There was no MEL sticker placed above the respected N1 gauge.I contacted Maintenance Control to confirm my understanding of the MEL regarding the incorrect Circuit Breakers and they confirmed the wrong circuit breaker had been pulled.  Notified ZZZ2 Maintenance and entered the discrepancy in the logbook. ZZZ2 Maintenance arrived and corrected the circuit breaker configuration and signed off the discrepancy I had entered. Missing information on the logbook sticker was also corrected.I have long felt that our MEL is VERY inadequate when it comes to circuit breaker identification.  In this particular instance the nomenclature is correct and was just applied incorrectly by the Mechanic; but if the C/B locations were included  it would have been much more apparent to the Mechanic as well as flight crew that the two C/B would not be immediately adjacent to each other.  I have brought this to the attention of Flight Ops previously with regards to other MEL's and have been advised that changes are slated for a future revision that has been delayed due to aircraft out of service returns; COVID and other issues. I also feel it should be reinforced to flight crews that MEL compliance is not solely the responsibility of the Maintenance department and that we should always verify (to the limits of our abilities) those aspects of MEL compliance which we have ready access to on each airplane we accept regardless of previous crews acceptance of the aircraft.",,"Two air carrier captains reported delays due to incorrect MEL procedures performed by maintenance and a passenger not complying with face mask policy.",

As we taxied back toward the Ramp; I coordinated with the Captain; advising that I felt it was appropriate to perform an After Landing flow prior to returning to the gate. Captain agreed; and I accomplished the flow.  While holding for a gate; and on the apron with the parking brake set; the A FA called back to the cockpit; advising that the passengers were now willing to comply and that the three FAs were comfortable with continuing the flight.At this point we re-accomplished a Before Taxi flow (as appropriate for our single engine taxi configuration); then ran a Before Taxi Checklist.  We then coordinated with ATC to proceed with a taxi clearance for departure. The Number 1 engine was started and the rest of the taxi and takeoff proceeded uneventfully.  Once airborne; I noticed that we had departed with the autobrake selector in the OFF position. As I thought about the sequence of events leading to that I thought of two things:  placing that switch to RTO takes place in the Captain's Before Start flow.  I also recalled that when I performed the After Start flow (following the Passenger incident); I placed the Window Heat switches to ON; another item that is normally accomplished in the Captain's Before Start flow.Clearly; in our unique situation; a Before Taxi flow; followed by a Before Taxi Checklist was insufficient to reposition all switches to their appropriate positions prior to taxi and takeoff. Of note; neither of us felt rushed; and we both felt that we used good CRM to methodically think through our situation before continuing; yet in the end; something was missing. I've referenced the manuals; looking for a procedure that would have trapped our errors; but am still left wondering.

This made the situation very chaotic. I was not aware of it being a 'quick-turn'; as I am always happy to try and help out with the quick-turn cleaning.The cleaners slipped on a few at a time; in between passengers leaving.

He said he wouldn't leave without it; and that his seat was XX6. He wanted to go look for it himself; but crew went to look.

The passengers are trying to look down the aisle and gauge how far we've gotten with the row announcements to deplane. Also; 2-3 pilots using the lavatory; gathering bags and leaving; while passengers are disembarking causes more confusion.

I contacted Dispatch who patched in the Supervisor for clarification on how to handle the situation. The passenger knew the rules well enough to know his compliance was required to get the aircraft in the air; but once we were airborne; he and his children removed their masks. The A-FA called the cockpit shortly after reaching our cruise altitude to inform me that this individual and children were not complying with the onboard mask mandate issued by the Federal Government; and that this individual had become rude and hostile when reminded that he was required to comply with the federal mandate.The A-FA also reported that children were not well behaved and were disrupting the nearby passengers. The A-FA reported that while asking this individual to wear a mask and control his children; one of the children was banging his head into the tray table of the seat back in front of the child. The FA said he touched the child's arm and said; 'You can't do that'. I notified Dispatch through ACARS of the events and set up the appropriate response team to meet the aircraft. I was kept informed of the actions of the individual for the remainder of the flight. As far as I know; the individual and children were not compliant with the mask requirement for the majority of the flight. I did talk to one of the passengers who witnessed the events.

It was a busy time in the flight deck where I was trying to manage the safety of the push. The FO answered the call to the flight deck from the cabin while I was talking to the ground crew and ramp was talking to our flight and the flight next to us pushing off the gate. The ramp personnel had left several pieces of ground equipment in the way of our push from X1 and we were trying to find out about getting it moved. As all of that is going on the narrative that myself and the FO got from the FA seemed to be one of more a compliance with the mask policy than one of weight and balance. She told us there was a large child sitting in a seat for which they were ticketed next to their mother and the child was having a hard time wearing the mask. The FA told us that the mother was now saying the child was less than 2. The FA believed that the mother was saying the child was less than 2 to skirt our mask policy and we needed to change the count for weight and balance because the child was an infant. I tried to clarify with the FA about the child because it was not clear to me because she was telling me the child was not listed as an infant; had their own seat; and by the FAs thought it was more about the mask. My thinking was that for the child to have that seat a birth date would have to be listed when that seat was purchased. Previously the FAs and the gate agent had reconciled the count; and the FA thought the child was older than 2; so I elected to leave the weight and balance as it stood. We continued to our destination without further incident.It was a busy time in the flight deck when this issue was brought to my attention. After things had calmed down with push I should have checked back with the FA to make sure I was hearing everything she was trying to tell me. Factors for me with my decision making were the high workload at the time; alertness because of the late time of day of the departure and having been scheduled with early AM shows for the three days prior to this event.",,"I walked through to do my cabin count and confirmed that I had a child in row XX just as it showed on the sheet. I had already asked the mom to get a mask on the child before we closed the weight/balance. She said the child did not have a mask so I brought her one. After the safety demo I walked through the cabin again for final compliance and saw the child was not wearing a mask. Mom said he had ripped it so I offered to get a new one. She then said that the other FA told her he didn't need one if he was under the age of 2. I was surprised to hear the child was an infant as he was quite large and had walked on board the aircraft by himself. I asked if he was still only 1 and she said he was not yet 2. I alerted the CA that I had possibly made a mistake in the count.  I mistakenly counted an infant as a child. I didn't ask how old the child was; it only came up because of non-compliance with mask policy.I honestly think she claimed the child was an infant in order to avoid dealing with the face mask.In the future I will make sure to ask passengers with small children if they are in fact under the age of 2.",,"Air carrier Captain and a Flight Attendant reported a passenger's child was resisting wearing a face mask. After this problem started the parent then stated the child was under 2 and did not need to wear the face mask.",

The child would not keep his/her seat belt fastened and kept removing his/her face covering. The parents had become belligerent with the flight attendants. We received a runway change just prior to pushback that would have us departing on Runway XXR verses YYL. The takeoff data for XXR included the requirement to burn off additional fuel prior to takeoff. We loaded the new takeoff data and reran the Before Push Checklist. Then we began our pushback from the gate. Knowing it would be a very short taxi to the runway; we started both engines. During the First Officer's After Start flow; I believe I interrupted his thought process by starting to voice my idea that we could taxi a short distance via [intersection] to Taxiway 1 and wait the little bit of time to burn off the additional taxi fuel.After completing the After Start flow; the First Officer did not make the 'Standing by Flaps' call. Instead; we talked for a few more seconds about moving the aircraft to a spot away from the ramp so that we could burn off the additional taxi fuel. The First Officer requested taxi clearance to Taxiway [Alphabet] and notified Ground Control that we would need to hold there; to burn off fuel prior to departing. We taxied forward onto [intersection] and made the left turn onto Taxiway 1 and brought the aircraft to a stop. Once the parking brake was set; we both realized that we had not performed the Before Taxi Checklist and subsequently had not set the flaps to the Takeoff setting prior to moving the aircraft. We then set the flaps to the Takeoff setting and ran the Before Taxi Checklist. After a couple of minutes; we had burned the proper amount of fuel for the taxi and we made an uneventful departure. It was immediately clear to me that I gave too much thought to the things that had happened prior to pushback and in doing that; caused me not to focus on the required duties after pushback.  I also should have allowed the First Officer to focus entirely on the after-start process before diverting his thoughts to something else.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported not performing the Before Taxi Checklist and subsequently had not set the flaps to the takeoff setting prior to moving the aircraft.

Approaching XXS; First Officer contacted Ramp [name2]. Ramp [name 2] responded with a clearance to taxi to [Spot] XXS and contact Ground at  [spot] XXS. Captain verbally reviewed triggers with First Officer for Before Take Off Flow and advised that a flight control check would commence on Taxiway C. Approaching [spot]  XXS Ground Control issued a clearance to taxi [Taxiways] Mike; Charlie; hold short C10 for [Runway] 18L. First Officer replied to Ground Control and Captain responded to the First Officer repeating the clearance with emphasis to Hold Short of C10. The taxi route was continuous without stops or delays. Numerous aircraft were on Taxiway C and positioned at various ramp location spots adjacent and parallel too Taxiway C. Two aircraft were positioned facing south at Spot XYE. The aft positioned aircraft at XYE had its landing/taxi lights illuminated while stationary.c. Flight control checks were initiated on Taxiway C prior to C10. During the initiation of the elevator check as the First Officer was verbalizing elevator position; Ground Control re-issued the taxi clearance to hold short of [Taxiway] C11. Flight control checks were discontinued; the taxi clearance was accepted and responded too by the First Officer. The Captain repeated and verbalized the clearance to the First Officer with emphasis to hold short of C11. Flight Control checks were re-initiated by the Captain. At full aft elevator the First Officer verbalized the elevator position simultaneously as Ground Control re-issued a clearance to continue to [Runway] 18L. The First Officer read back the clearance. The Captain repeated the clearance to the First Officer. The Captain maintained full aft elevator during the communication with Ground Control and the First Officer.d. Flight control checks re-initiated from the beginning of the Before Take Off Flow and the remaining flow items were completed. The taxi/landing lights from the aft aircraft at [Spot] XYE were obscuring the view on Taxiway C. The Captain stopped the aircraft in a position on Taxiway C that used the forward aircraft's wing at Spot XYE to block the glare from the aft aircraft at Spot XYE. The Captain gave a courtesy flash of the taxi light to alert the crew of the aircraft on XYE of their landing/taxi light illumination. The First Officer verbalized and switched Radio One to the Tower Control frequency. The parking brake was set. The Captain called for the Before Take Off checklist. Task Loading increased due to a reduced time factor in the task/time equation. Flight crew members were in the green area of the [threat mode]; however external factors were compressing the time component and additional time elements would be required to remain out of the yellow and in the green area of the threat mode paradigm.e. As the Before Take Off checklist was being accomplished the aircraft on [Taxiway] C12 was cleared on to [Runway] 18L; however no clearance was heard on the radio. At this time both the Captain and the First Officer deduced that an incorrect frequency was selected on Radio One. The error was trapped and corrected. The flight crew was now in the yellow area of the threat mode paradigm due to a high task load environment.f. Upon tuning of the Tower frequency; the crew re-initiated the Before Take Off Checklist. Simultaneously the Tower Controller issued a clearance to proceed onto the runaway. The Tower Controller's voice conveyed a tone of agitation; immediacy; anger and frustration. Additionally; the Tower Controllers diction was rapid; difficult to hear and understand. For reasons of safety; the crew declined the clearance. The flight crew again attempted to complete the Before Take Off Checklist. The Tower Controller responded with agitation and another clearance that was rapid and difficult to understand with a demand to expedite taxi onto the runway and in some manner exit the runway. We advised the Tower we would need 30 seconds and we would be ready for departure. The Tower Controller responded again with agitation and anger and demanded we taxi onto the active runway in an expedited manner; with a rapid diction pattern and clearance that we were unable to understand while an aircraft was approaching the runway for landing as we were being lambasted by the Tower Controller regarding other traffic waiting to depart.g. At this point the demands from the Tower Controller had compromised the safe operation of the aircraft as the issued clearances appeared too no longer be operationally motivated. The Captain momentarily took over radio communication and advised the tower that we were unable to accept the clearance. Our decision to not move the aircraft was driven by safety concerns and based on the threat mode model. The true safest course of action was to keep the aircraft stationary until the task loading paradigm could be shifted to normal operational expectations.h. The Tower Controller remained agitated and instructed the crew to copy a telephone number and demanded a call tothe number. The Tower Controller read the number; we advised that we received the number and the Tower Controller re-read the number a second time and got a digit incorrect in the second reading and self-corrected their error of the telephone number. We confirmed receipt. The Before Take Off Checklist was completed; and we advised the Tower Controller we were ready for departure.The CLT airport during this bank of flights and the previous bank of flights was a chaotic mess; as is the case with CLT with all banks of flights. Aircraft crew transiting into an out of the 1 and 2 concourse are subject to extraordinary delays and the resultant increase in stress as are the Ramp Controllers and local ATC controllers. This high level of stress with too many aircraft movements in too small of space is a significant negative factor in the safety equation. The attempts by airlines to operate in this manner is a contributing factor to the degradation of safety and the stress applied to all personnel is a concrete byproduct of this poor planning and management. Further; the manifest stress is evident in the voice; demeanor and diction of ATC and other personnel which results in a degrade performance profile.Reduce access and aircraft movements in the 1 and 2 concourses to better manage traffic flow. Properly staff and monitor ATC positions and personnel for signs of stress. Review and stream line CLT Ramp operations and coordination with ATC Ground Control.",,"1.

This lead to interruptions in our checklists; flows; and SOPs.Perhaps we should complete the 'before takeoff flow' and before takeoff checklist in the ramp area when using 18L. Although CLT Ramp is not going to like that. Also the ATC Tower Controller should sit jumpseat when we are using 18L to observe the task saturation.

We didn't go beyond 200 ft. difference and never got an ALT miscompare message.At cruise (FL350) the difference was roughly 130 ft.During descent in to ZZZ; I don't know when exactly it showed up; but I noticed at roughly FL330 during the descent we had a ALT message flashing on my altimeter.  I thought maybe the BARO knob on my side or the FO side got bumped.  I checked and saw that all three altimeters were showing STD.  Then the message went away only to show up 100-200 ft. later.  I looked at the altitudes and saw that we were either 200 or greater but not more than 220 ft. off. But then the next 100-200 ft. we were 200 ft. or less on the miscompare and the ALT message went away only for in the next 100-200 ft. for the ALT message to return and the discrepancy being 200 ft. or greater.It back and forth intermittently until roughly FL290; possibly lower; I do not recall when exactly the issue stopped.I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to inform them and so that they could inform maintenance so that the issue could start getting worked on when we got to the gate.I also informed ZZZ Operations on the in range call what was going on and that we would need maintenance.I was looking through the QRH to see if there was a checklist for it just in case even though I was pretty sure there wasn't one.This being the first time that this has occurred to me; I unfortunately did not think to reference the standby altimeter to try to help isolate where the fault may lie; as the issue went away while I was diligently looking for a checklist and the issue was intermittent.  Also because it was intermittent and went away on its own I also did not think to inform ATC since we were already in the process of exiting RVSM.No other messages on any display unit; including the EICAS; showed while this was happening nor throughout the remainder of the flight.We landed in ZZZ without incident.I should have known that there wasn't a checklist for this issue and I need to read back up on alt miscompare procedures and how it affects RVSM and what to do.  I should have informed ATC and I should have referenced the standby altimeter to help isolate the problem.  Otherwise I think we did everything else correctly.After working with Maintenance in ZZZ it turns out the number 4 probe had failed even though we didn't get any messages other than the ALT message on the altimeters.  Maintenance said that there when they initially went through their task that there wasn't any active or logged faults with the system and that they had to do another task to isolate where to problem was; in this case the faulty probe.",,"In ZZZ; during descent we had an ALT disagree message during descent.Upon arrival into ZZZ we had everyone deplane; had maintenance come on and do some checks.They were able to isolate the issue and ascertained it was going to be a lengthy delay.We got word that our new departure time was going to be XE:00 so we got a day room.We got back to the airport at XD:15 for the re-report time.Upon arriving at the aircraft I was informed that there was still work to do but that they just needed to tape a cover back onto the plane for one of the pitot tubes.After that they still needed to do some testing and that it would be about 30 more minutes.So; we went to the crew room to wait for the work to be done.I went back out several times to get updates and each time the return to service kept getting pushed back.Finally; once it became a return to service time of XG:00 I realized that we were going to be within an hour of our FDP (Flight Duty Period) time out in ZZZ1.So; I called scheduling and got a wheels up time of XG:55 before the pilots timed out and due to contractual issues that the main cabin door needed to be closed at XG:34. I was told that Maintenance would call ZZZ Operations who would then call me in the crew room when Maintenance was done in the flight deck and that we could go to the plane; preflight; board; and wait for the maintenance log to come back so we could hopefully get out in time.The call did not come in until roughly XG:10.We went out to the aircraft; I told the flight to not rush the preflight. I told them to take their time; not to slow down so that we didn't hit our times; but so that something wouldn't be missed; prevent mistakes; keep us legal and not on the wrong side of SOPs and Regs.We were able to accomplish our preflight in a timely matter; board in a timely matter; and we were able to get the MCD closed at XG:32. The AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) hadn't returned yet so I figured let's get the door closed so that we hit the Flight Attendant contract time and that hopefully the AML would arrive soon and could be handed to us through the flight deck window.I called Dispatch to make sure we were on the correct revision since we had a hard time getting our IFR clearance. I verified all the fuel and time values along with the correct revision. A few minutes after that a Ramp crew member came to the flight deck informing us that the fuel truck had arrived. There was apparently some confusion about fuel. I initially dismissed the fuel truck only to decide that I should make sure that wasn't any last second changes. So; I called Dispatch to re-verify our fuel numbers. There wasn't any changes and I moved on to the next step.Some time after this the AML arrived around XE:40-XE:45.After the cabin secured and we started our air start checklists due to the APU being INOP.At this point I knew that our timeline most likely wouldn't work but that it would close and that we needed to give our best effort.Right as we got to the part in the checklist to apply air to the aircraft for the air start; the FAs (Flight Attendants) called and informed us that a passenger had gotten up to use the lavatory. I told them to let me know when they had returned and were seated.I told the ground crew to apply air but that we were going to wait for the passenger to come out of the lavatory since the cabin was no longer secured. I do not know if this was the right call but I thought that it was the best call in regards to safety.After a minute or two we got a call from the FAs that there was a possible passenger removal situation going on. I asked what was going on and they informed me that the passenger was being non-compliant with the face mask and was being non-cooperative and nasty in the process.Knowing that we as a whole crew were feeling stressed; tired; and unhappy about all the delays I made sure to ask had we been on time; no maintenance; still XA:30; would this situation rise to the passenger beingremoved. They talked about for a few seconds and agreed that it wasn't. I then instructed them that since he was still being non-compliant; go back one more time and see if we can get him compliant and in line or that we would then look into removal and top report back.After a minute or two I was called back and the FAs informed that the passenger was apologetic and now being compliant and we were good to go.At this point; with the cabin re-secured; I turned back to do the air start. I glanced at the clock to check our time and it was XG:51. At this point I knew that there was no possible way to get the air start; taxi; second engine start; and wheels up at XG:55.I conferred with the FO (First Officer) if he was in agreement and if he was willing to do an extension. He gave valid reason for not doing an extension and agreed with me that there was no possible way that we could get wheels up by XG:55. The reason I asked him was just to get a second opinion and he reaffirmed everything that was already thinking. I had already decided once I saw it was XG:51 that we were done; that there was no point in starting the engines; wasting fuel; taxiing out and turning back. The most efficient and economical path was to admit defeat on there being no possible way to make it off by XG:55 for FDP limit reasons and throw in the towel.We had been fighting a losing battle; we did everything we could to safely get the plane going in time and we just had too many issues pop to delay us going out.I then informed the ramp that we had timed out and to pull the ramp back to the plane and that I would inform the Flight Attendants to do arrival procedures and that we were going to deplane.The FO and did after landing and parking flows and checklists.I then exited the flight deck to tell Flight Attendant A that we were done and to do arrival procedures and that I would inform the passengers.I wanted to be out in the cabin for the announcement to not only own the decision but to not leave our Flight Attendants hanging to deal with potentially irate passengers.I made the PA informing them what was going one; the regulations on duty limits; that we tried our best but unfortunately had timed out and that we need to deplane; that they would be taken care of inside the terminal and apologized profusely for the situation.The passengers got off; mostly understanding; some were understandably irritated; but left without incident.I called crew scheduling to let them know and it sounded like word had gotten around already.We waited with the plane until a hotel was assigned. We then shut down the aircraft; secured it; turned it over to the ramp crew; and left the airport.It was a comedy of setbacks. It was just one thing after another. If it wasn't for the passenger; or the maintenance; or the air start due to the APU being broken; take any one or two items out of the equation and we most likely would have made it. It was a losing battle from the get go; we just didn't know it until the time came were there was no possible way to get out in time.I believe we did everything safely; timely; accurately; with safety and service in mind. At no time did myself; the FO; or FAs intentionally slow down the operation for the goal of timing out. The times we slowdown was to make sure things were done safely and correctly; to catch our breaths; and move on the next step to be completed; all with safety in mind.I do not know what else we could have done. We were ready and on time until the passenger; air start; AML delay; fuel confusion came about. It just wasn't our day.That being said; in order to help speed up AML paperwork we should seriously look into getting electronic AMLs and maintenance. This has a huge potential to cut down the time it takes to get paperwork done. Plus; since we would have access to the AML on our iPads and that the AML lives in the cloud that anyone in the operation can access; we wouldn't have to wait for the AML to come back tothe aircraft. Just like in [program] we would get an alert that the AML is finished; review the changes; sign off on the review; and be on our way in a significantly shorter time.In addition to that; ZZZ is not only a base but also a place where maintenance takes place. There shouldn't be an excuse to not have parts and/or the tools necessary to get jobs done. We shouldn't be having to rely on parts and tools being flown in and we definitely shouldn't be relying on borrowing tools from [other airline] like our maintenance had to do today. I understand that it would be expensive to do all of that but is it more expensive than what we just paid for crew to stay in ZZZ in a more expensive hotel; giving 500-dollar voucher to the passenger in addition to getting them hotel rooms and food vouchers? More expensive than the domino effect that just occurred down the line. Vouchers and hotels were given to those passengers in ZZZ1 no doubt. It's more expensive to not give our Mechanics the resources to do their jobs in a timely fashion than it is to try to save money on parts and tools. Also; across all [aircraft type]; things are failing at; to me; an alarming rate. Be it in the cabin or on the flight deck; these planes are not that old and should not be having things break this much; this fast. We need to stop kicking the can down the road and actually fix things rather than defer and hope for the best. Also; we need to figure out why things are breaking so much so often so soon. This is getting embarrassing and the 3rd major delay; break; cancellation in the past week for me and in talking with other crews and ramp crews; I'm not the only one experiencing these issues. We clearly have systemic issue that we are either unable or unwilling to address and sooner than later it is going to bite us real hard and cause a serious incident or accident.",,"Air carrier Captain reported a delay followed by a cancelled flight due to a discrepancy between the Captain's and First Officer's altimeters on a previous flight which led to maintenance action.",

Once the flight reached cruise altitude I received a call from the [A Flight Attendant] that discussed with me he had a passenger with mask compliance issue and that he had spoken to the passenger several times. He also had the other crew members check on the passenger who was with a teenage child. I asked him to try again; and issue information for noncompliance if needed. Later he called me and said he had attempted to give the information to the passenger who refused it; and also refused to wear the mask. He had asked the teenager to also wear the mask; but the parent had snapped at him and said it was a child and leave them alone. The teenager was acting as if asleep; but not wearing a mask either. I took note of the names; and contacted dispatch. The dispatcher let the Customer Service (CS) know the details and we were told they would meet the flight. As the flight continued; this became more of a distraction as many other passengers were visibly upset about the passenger not wearing a mask; and several stated that it compromised their safety. Several people wanted to be moved as it wasn't a full flight; however the passenger causing the problem was in a premium seat. When we took a bathroom break; passengers approached my First Officer about the issue even though it isn't allowed for passengers to come up front when the cart is out protecting the cockpit.

She showed me a picture of the bags and expressed concern as to their contents. I had her inquire with the customer as to the contents of the bag and was informed they were Lithium Ion spare batteries. The customer in Seat XX volunteered to have the flight attendant bring one of the bags to the flight deck for us to review the batteries; which she did. Upon opening the bag; we found four Lithium Ion loose batteries rated for 211Wh each. The first officer and I both reviewed FOM and determined that the batteries exceeded the 100Wh limit and 160Wh limit for PEMD outlined in the FOM. I contacted the Chief Pilot to confirm the limit was applicable and make sure there was not an alternative way to carry the batteries. The Chief Pilot consulted with company Dangerous Goods team and confirmed the batteries were not allowed. I requested a CS (customer service) supervisor at the aircraft via operations radio call and a request in the app (I incorrectly stated in the app that it was a checked bag) to find a resolution for the customer. My radio and request for CS supervisor were at XA18. At XA28 I walked up the jetbridge to check on status of supervisor arriving and found the gate agent with a CS lead present at the gate counter. I tried explaining the situation with the lead but kept getting strange follow up questions and no indication the lead wanted to go down to the aircraft to assist the customer with a resolution. After several minutes of discussion; another lead walked up. The original lead explained that it was XA30 and he was scheduled to be off and was happy the new lead had arrived so he could leave.I explained the situation to the new CS lead and reviewed the FOM battery limit reference with him. He immediately went down to the aircraft and was able to resolve the issue. The customer elected to continue on the flight and the CS lead took possession of both bags for the customer to have someone pick up at baggage services.

I was cleared for takeoff; right turn 140. I began to turn right; I encountered some wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft. The aircraft "burbled" a little and rolled right further. The passenger in the copilot seat grabbed the yoke with his right hand; and attempted to pull and put in left aileron. I maintained positive control of the aircraft; pushed their hand off; and told them "no." At a safe altitude I explained that it was just a wake turbulence encounter and there was no reason for them to panic. As they looked young and I understood their fear in turbulence I elected to continue the flight. However; this was extremely dangerous; these are the opposite control inputs for a stall/spin to the right on takeoff; and would have exacerbated that condition. In fact if they had pulled aggressively enough at low altitude and airspeed they could have caused a takeoff stall at an unrecoverable altitude and killed us. I believe the passenger was not trained in upset recovery; if they thought there was a loss of control inflight with a right roll; the correct input should have been lower the angle of attack and then re-orient the lift vector with the rudder. They were probably afraid of the ground rush. I did specifically write please put a small adult in the copilot seat on the passenger information list; although I believe this person was at least 16 - I could see their driver's license in their phone case - so I see why the Ramp Agent put them there. I do believe this passenger acted inappropriately; only 10 minutes before this event I had explained to them that they should not be touching the flight controls. I will not fly that passenger in the front seat ever again.",,,,"Small transport Captain reported encountering wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft upon takeoff.

It was 105 degrees at ZZZ this particular day. We began boarding with very limited airflow in the cabin and the temperature began to increase to a very uncomfortable level. We closed the boarding door and before the cockpit door was closed the captain had informed the [Flight Attendant] A that we might have an issue with our tires. While waiting for maintenance to come out the temperature in the cabin began getting even worse. Passengers were vocal about their discomfort. Took maintenance about 40 minutes to tell us that we'd need to deplane. During that time the captain made 1 PA to passengers letting them know what was happening. Captain claimed he informed the tower we would need to deplane and needed an agent to bring the jet bridge back to the plane. That took an additional 30 minutes to get an agent to open the door. During this time passengers began getting inpatient (rightfully so) and a few passengers threatened to open emergency exits. Others started telling other passengers to call 911 for help. Once the door was finally opened the agent refused to let any passengers off until she took the temperature in the cabin. Drenched in sweat we were then asked to rush to a new gate to board another plane only to wait an additional 40 minutes for catering. We also had a few elderly passengers claiming they were close to losing consciousness because of the heat. Also had a kid sick from the heat. Suggestions: We have to stop boarding planes that don't have a functioning APU or proper A/C. It's so inhumane and ridiculous that we even do it in the first place. Something very bad is going to happen to a passenger one day due to these conditions. Captains need to refuse these planes and they need to be fixed.",,"Boarded aircraft knowing 1 engine had to be manually started. We were not getting much air at all during boarding. Aircraft was heating up rapidly. Full flight. Doors closed; jet bridge pushed back when they went to start the 2nd engine. That took awhile. We then found out we had a low/flat tire. Outside temp was 106 deg. To chug tire they had to turn off engines. It was really hot. Then needed to deplane but the engines had already been turned off. No agent could be contacted. We waited over 30 min from Captain trying to get agents to open the door. People were throwing up; XX yr old pax; new horns; one pax yelling call 911 and a pax threatening to blow a slide to get out. People were getting hysterical. Crew was trying to calmly deal with this horrendous situation at the gate in ZZZ. WE NEVER LEFT THE GATE. DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AGENT WAS. When she finally arrived she was rude and insisting our flight number and where we had come from. We were in emergency mode at this point. She then blocked our exit to get a temp reading. She was totally in the way and causing us from deplaning. She called her manager sometime while we were trying to get off the plane. One [of] the crew got off the manager started lecturing us about our brand and got in my face and totally discriminating against us as she verbally attacked and bullied us. It wasn't until the [Flight Attendant] A got her to back off. Maintenance called and was no help. We we all dehydrated; headaches and I for one felt like I had heatstroke and was in shock. Company had us continue onto ZZZ1 on another plane. I was so out of it and just sort of went with what we were TOLD to do. One body on the ground showed us any help or compassion. Heat stroke is real and I believe I had it and was dehydrated tooSuggestions: FAA need to hold airlines accountable in these extreme heat situation. People in ZZZ are dying due to the extreme heat this summer. Being locked up in a metal tube with no air is absolutely inhumane and can cause death. I hope that doesn't happen so Company needs to step up their guidelines and restrictions to take these broken planes all over. Airplanes must have air in the summer regardless before it can leave a gate.",,"A321 flight attendants reported excessive cabin temperature due to an equipment problem and high outside temperature.

When we boarded the aircraft; I asked the CA (Captain) to get the plane cooled down. Once boarding time (XA:23 hrs) came; the aircraft cabin was still at the same temp; 87°. I asked if the APU was inop and was told that it was working and blowing out cool air. Following the guidelines for boarding a warm aircraft; sec. X.X.X; states; 'do not wait until temperatures reach 90 degrees.' I brought it up to the flight deck four more times in the first 40 minutes. I had already dimmed the windows to 5 and announced for the passengers to open their air vents throughout boarding. Additionally; I spoke several times during boarding with Person A; the person ramping. I also reached out on Company communication twice about the temperature. The cabin temperature raised to 88°; then 89°. I pointed out to Person A and the pilots; once again; that the manual clearly states not to wait until it hits 90°; to be proactive. Person A just kept telling me that it wasn't 90° yet so nothing was to be done. I was clearly the only person being proactive as I could not get anyone else to take any action. We went through business class several times with predeparture beverages and also ice water I made in the galley. The aircraft got to 90° and about the same time; the #2 called and said the pax were getting very angry and unruly in the back. Since I had gotten nowhere with everything I did this entire time; I asked the #2 to come up front to help me communicate this information to the inflight and gate personnel there. #2 had gotten so overheated that he took off his outer shirt and had a t-shirt on underneath. He tried to cool down with wearing just the t-shirt and an apron (the apron was so he was recognizable as flight crew). When he came up; Person A got very concerned about #2 not being in 'full uniform compliance.' Person A started typing messages to the senior manager in charge about #2's uniform. I was extremely disappointed that this disciplinary move was the ONLY actual action I saw going on from the very people I was pleading for help with during our entire hot aircraft dilemma; which was now getting worse. We already knew pretty early in the boarding process that we would be on a maintenance delay because someone had accidentally damaged the outside of the aircraft fuselage. As no one here was new at this job; we all realized it was going to be a while for maintenance to go through the steps in the manual and sign off the logbook. Just as the temperatures kept creeping up; so did our maintenance delay. Pax in the back were shouting and FAs (flight attendants) were worried not only about the safety of pax due to overheating; but also that someone was going to get violent. Still; the only thing being done was a message being sent about #2's full uniform not being worn. After all this time of getting nothing actionable done about the heat; FAs told irate pax to go toward the boarding door to speak with personnel there. Pax were wanting to get off and wanting to get a more realistic time for the delay instead of the 'about another 10 minutes or so' they had heard over and over by this point. The situation was really getting out of control. Incidentally; the coolest place on the aircraft at this point was also in the galley between 2L & 2R because; in an effort to keep themselves from getting sick; FAs had opened the compartment doors so the chillers could be felt by them. I called Dispatch because I couldn't reach the Tower. Dispatch called the Tower for me. I messaged Company. I asked for more management to come down as all my time spent being proactive could not get a single thing done if the flight deck and passenger service refused to take action. Finally; at approx XC:30 hrs; a customer service manager came down; and I explained how out of control the situation was getting. We hadn't gotten much movement on the temperature; the pax were getting angrier and angrier; and the delay was still going on. As Iwas relaying this info to the customer service manager; a pax near door 2L was again loudly saying that it's inhumane for us to keep them on this aircraft. Also; there was an employee; an older; slender in build gentleman in a suit with glasses who suddenly claimed we were 'egging' the pax on. It was then that the customer service manager asked me to go to door 1L with him so we could speak without all this interference. I continued to explain all that had gone on and was going on. The suited employee had followed us up there. I explained that it was 87° when we boarded and I had started sounding the alarms; had climbed to 88°; then 89° and 90°. Suddenly; the suited employee exclaimed that it NEVER got to 90°. I said; yes; it had and that I had even taken a picture of it. I turned the phone to show him the picture and he yelled at me to step back and keep my distance from him. Confused; I looked at the customer service manager; who immediately apologized and said he'd talk to him. I asked the customer service manager if the gentlemen was accusing me of charging him or becoming aggressive. The customer service manager said it appeared that way; but agreed that I didn't do anything; and said; again; that he would have a talk with him. A business class pax then said they could not believe how the man just spoke to me. I then asked the customer service manager if no action had been taken all of this time because of a much too pervasive attitude in our company that I; as the #1 FA; must be overreacting to the situation or something? Am I just being labeled as hysterical; even when I have been calmly advocating for something to be done for over two hours now and had not had a negative interaction with anyone up until now? The customer service manager again said he'd have a talk with the suited employee. We finally got word we were ready to go; closed the door and pushed back at XC:45; 2 hours and 22 minutes after beginning boarding with the 87° temperature. We took off at XD:09. At XD:21; the temp in the cabin was still 83° and our temperature at XD:55; after being in the air for 46 minutes was only cooled down to 77°; even though we had it set much lower than that.Suggestions: I'm not sure how much more I can say other than we HAVE to do better for our passengers. It does absolutely ZERO good for us to have warm aircraft policies if the Captain and the ground personnel refuse to take action. Our passengers entrust us with their safety; and we need to take that responsibility more seriously. Heat exhaustion is a very real thing and poses a very real threat to our passengers' and crewmembers' health and safety. According to the Cleveland Clinic; between 10 and 65% of people with non-exertional heatstroke die from the illness. Some other people experience permanent organ damage or neurological dysfunction; and we cannot always predict who it will affect. However; we CAN provide preventative measures if we all get on the same page with this policy. I pray that this company will not wait to take action until it's far too late to protect someone from irreparable harm. I am willing to be a part of this solution; but I obviously cannot change anything without the support of the other workgroups who are supposed to make up a functioning team that adheres to the policies set forth by the company. Additionally; we have been provided with uniforms that do not breathe properly. We have no summer option; other than to remove outerwear. Why is it not mandatory that we be provided with a summer option of natural materials that breathe in these extreme conditions?",,,,"B787 Flight Attendant reported a high temperature cabin temperature during boarding and during the first hour of the flight.

We landed without issue and we were met with fire trucks thank god we were okay. After de planing we were walked to our new gate and the supervisor did a great job at the time they asked if we had knowledge if it was [a request for priority handling] and I said no and the Captain said it was. I did not have direct from them during the flight that it was; Supervisor said that that was not uncommon and we were offered coffee to which seemed genuine at the time and we had a brand new plane and flight deck officers. The pilots were not given the flight number or plan yet and said that we will board later to take a breather because we had a lot going on and they wanted to make sure we were all okay and safety checks were thoroughly completed. The Gate Agent said they would check to see when we were ready to board and I looked to my left and passengers were boarding before the okay from anyone. I am unaware of the time stamp but it was very soon after we checked in to the aircraft. We stopped passengers. I let the Captain know and they were upset and said they had not still not been given the flight plan or anything they were just thrown on the flight and needed just a little time to brief us because we were already delayed. There was no need to rush boarding. Also we did not have one cart on board; which typically boarding should not delay because of that but we had time and wiggle room to take a breath. I was unable to contact my worried family members and do our checks. As I asked for passengers to wait until we had confirmation on why boarding was starting; I was met with the accusation that I specifically was holding boarding and that was not the actual situation. We were actually boarding prior to the Captain and myself's acknowledgment. I just wanted clarity so that everyone was on the same page. The passengers had already been through enough and sitting on a plane that was not ready was not the best solution for anyone. Communication was very off. After I was met with the accusations things escalated very quickly and I did not feel supported as I did when I was immediately met with plane side when I landed. I felt like the coffee was a bribery for me to take so that we were comfortable with rush boarding and a quick departure. I became overwhelmed and needed support on what to do so I called the union to see what my options were. I initially just wanted a little time to breathe that was all I was asking for and I was met with a supervisor that told me I was prepared for these incidences and they didn't see the problem and that I needed to choose a different career if I couldn't handle it. I immediately became so overwhelmed and I was overcome with emotions at that point I realized I no longer felt okay to work the flight. I called Crew Scheduling and spoke to someone from the ZZZ team and was asked what was going on and I was cut off over and over during my conversation so much that I asked them if they were telling my story for me or if they truly cared about what I was saying. It was very overwhelming. I did not refuse to fly I was unfit to fly and I was bullied and threatened with a missed trip and I did not agree. I just was no longer able to focus. I was crying and it was no longer safe for me to fly.

While descending well into the arrival; we received a "SMOKE FWD LAV" warning message. We also heard the beeping from the smoke detector in the main cabin. The Captain initiated me to run "SMOKE FWD LAV QRH." Shortly after turning to the QRH Checklist page; ATC gave us instructions preparing us for final vectors to land. It was at this time we let ATC know we had an issue and relayed the message we received. The Captain instructed me to [request priority handling] with ATC. ATC responded and asked how many souls and pounds of fuel onboard. I let them know that information; and the Captain got a call from the Flight Attendant believing they could smell a slight burning smell from the front lavatory area. In addition; the "SMOKE FWD LAV" warning message extinguished. After he gathered this information from them; I returned to the QRH. However; both the Captain and I agreed due to our low altitude and workload management getting the aircraft ready for landing; it would be best to both focus on configuring the aircraft safely. He transferred controls to me while he made maybe one or two more calls to the flight attendants; and coordinated with ATC for response. Landing was uneventful. ATC asked if we would like to taxi off or if the trucks should come to us. ATC said it is no problem for the trucks to come to us; and we said to standby while we checked in with the Flight Attendant on the situation. The forward Flight Attendant said; "The smell is getting stronger." I relayed this to the Captain and he said we will be evacuating here. He instructed me to begin the Evacuation Checklist which then triggered the evacuation. Evacuation happened without incident or injuries.",,"On approach for landing; Passenger A used the forward lavatory. While in the lavatory the smoke detector went off for about 15 seconds. Passenger A did not come out right away - maybe 8 - 10 seconds after smoke detector stopped. When they came out; there was a cloud of smoke that followed her. I even noticed it coming from their hair as she sat down. I immediately questioned if they were smoking. They said; "No." I explained that the only time the smoke detector goes off is because there is smoke. They asked if it was a malfunction - I said no. I asked them if they could see any smoke coming from anywhere in the lavatory or smell smoke. They said; no. I asked aft FA (Flight Attendant) to check for any signs of smoke or fire in the lavatory and to check the halon to see if it went off/activated. I asked Passenger A if they were vaping. They said no. I could smell smoke - not cigarette smoke; but smoke from something burning. The aft FA said that the halon is still in normal mode; she checked for fire and hotspots and didn't find anything. But she said she could smell smoke too. I also checked for hotspots; smoke and fire in the lavatory and in the galley service area.Within minutes of the smoke detector sound stopping; the Flight Deck; FD; called and told aft FA we have a priority situation. Aft FA told me that the Captain was unclear in his description. I called to verify/confirm. Captain said that; "We have a priority situation - we got an alert indicator of smoke in forward lavatory and that emergency personnel will meet us upon landing on tarmac. Prepare for normal landing. Standby for further instructions." I said that I believed a passenger was smoking in the forward lavatory. Aft FA and I were in process of putting service items away when all of this happening. So we quickly secured the galley and then I made the preparation PA. Right before touching down; the smell of smoke became stronger; but no visible smoke. We landed and stopped on tarmac. I waited for direction from Captain. He called and said emergency personnel are on their way and to wait to open the door. I said that the smell of smoke got stronger. He then said we're going to evacuate. After what seem like a long 1 - 2 minutes he made PA "Evacuate!" The power was off; so I began to yell at the passengers to "come this way - evacuate now!" Passengers began grabbing their belongings; so I yelled; "LEAVE EVERYTHING; EVACUATE; COME THIS WAY!" Passengers were evacuated within 3 - 4 minutes. I went to Passenger A and asked them if they were using any kind of spray. They said no. Everyone was accounted for with no injuries.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a smoke in lavatory warning message during descent and a flight attendant reported smoke was seen in the forward lavatory; possibly due to a passenger smoking in the lav.

The passenger was an elderly female appearing to wear some type of mask with tubing attached down to what appeared to be some type of box. This was far more elaborate than a surgical or cloth mask; but also did not appear to be a portal personal oxygen container (PPOC); nor did it appear on our final paperwork. FA3 felt that this mask was a prohibited item and asked me to check out the passenger and her mask; and then tell her to stop using the device (I do not know whether FA2 or FA4 also had concerns about this). FA3 then directed me to seat 22C; where the passenger was sitting. After finishing delivering a few drinks to my passengers in first class and reviewing the manual on PPOCs and allowed and prohibited items; I went to row 22 to find the passenger and check out the mask. As I approached that row; the seat was empty and the passenger had left her seat and gone the aft lavatories. I waited outside the lavs until she came out; saw the mask; was unsure exactly what it was myself and asked her out of curiosity to tell me about what she was wearing/using. She told me it was a portable HEPA (high-efficiency particulate absorbing) filter that she used; and the device appeared to run on battery power. Since the closest reference I found in prohibited items was a personal humidifier (which this was not); I did not confront her about it but watched the passenger go instead and take a seat at 20C then. Without knowing enough about the device; whether or not it was allowed or prohibited; nor where the passenger was actually seated; or any mention of it on my paperwork; I did not take any further actions. I do not recall seeing the device during the boarding process; though I could easily have been looking away; preparing a pre-departure beverage then while she boarded or the passenger herself was not wearing the device then. I am not sure whether I committed a FAR or Safety violation here; which is why I am reporting this. If the device is allowed on the flight; then flight attendants also need to know before potentially harassing someone unnecessarily for another form of approved mask or facial covering onboard.Suggestions:Can you please provide clarity on portable HEPA devices; whether in a bulletin or a manual? What are the potential danger(s) of these devices; if any; and under what conditions and/or restrictions can passengers use them in flight? Do TSA; agents; and flight crew need to know about and flag these devices for further inspection and or notes on our final paperwork? On the passenger side of things; what can airlines do to make it clearer about HEPA filtration systems already used on passenger aircraft; and make better informed decisions about bring portable HEPA devices onboard?",,,,"Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a passenger was using a portable HEPA filter device in flight.
