## Why Are Unruly Airline Passengers More Common Than Ever?

#### Background: In the last four years, there has been a substantial increase in unruly passenger behavior on airlines. Many factors have been suggested to contribute to this increase, including flight delay times, overbooking seats, alcohol consumption, and changing social norms since the pandemic. The central question addressed in the proposed research is: why is unruly passenger behavior on airlines more common than ever? 
#### The proposed analysis will utilize flight data, including records of delays and cancellations, associated passenger disturbances, and other surrounding factors. The analysis will be conducted using R, with the predictor variable being Delay Time/Cancellation. Potential feature variables include flight duration, passenger demographics, and peak season/off season.


#### Research Question: Why Are Unruly Airline Passengers More Common Than Ever?

#### Hypothesis: Passengers are more likely to behave unruly and cause disturbances when flights are delayed or canceled.

#### Predictions: Unruly passenger behavior is more likely to occur when flights are delayed or canceled. For every hour a flight is delayed and a passenger has to wait before boarding a new flight, there is a 10% increase in the chance that they will exhibit unruly behavior.
